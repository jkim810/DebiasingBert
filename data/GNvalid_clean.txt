= homarus gammarus =
homarus gammarus , known as the european lobster or common lobster , is a species of [MASK] lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts of the black sea .
it is closely related to the american lobster , h. americanus .
it may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws .
in life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking .
mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into [MASK] larvae .
homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles .
= = description = =
homarus gammarus is a large [MASK] , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 .
 7 – 2 .
 2 kg ( 1 .
 5 – 4 .
 9 lb ) .
like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard [MASK] which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called [MASK] ( [MASK] ) .
this may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals .
the first pair of [MASK] is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws .
the larger one is the " [MASK] " , and has rounded [MASK] used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey .
usually , the left claw is the [MASK] , and the right is the cutter .
the [MASK] is generally blue above , with spots that [MASK] , and yellow below .
the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking .
this occurs because , in life , the red pigment [MASK] is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment .
the closest relative of h. gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus .
the two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap .
the two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics :
the [MASK] of h. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in h. gammarus .
the spines on the claws of h. americanus are red or red - tipped , while those of h. gammarus are white or white - tipped .
the underside of the claw of h. americanus is orange or red , while that of h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .
= = life cycle = =
female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 .
 1 – 3 .
 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size .
mating typically occurs in summer between a recently [MASK] female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard - shelled male .
the female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her [MASK] .
the female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to him [MASK] .
the female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to his [MASK] .
females carrying eggs are said to be " [MASK] " and can be found throughout the year .
the eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on [MASK] .
this stage involves three [MASK] and lasts for 15 – 35 days .
after the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a [MASK] lifestyle .
the juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows .
it is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 , 000 survives to the [MASK] phase .
when they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 .
 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives .
= = distribution = =
homarus gammarus is found across the north - eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco , not including the baltic sea .
it is also present in most of the mediterranean sea , only missing from the section east of crete , and along only the north - west coast of the black sea .
the [MASK] populations are found in the norwegian [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] , inside the arctic circle .
the species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment .
the first of these is the population of lobsters from northern norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight - sun lobster " .
the populations in the mediterranean sea are distinct from those in the atlantic ocean .
the last distinct population is found in the netherlands : samples from the [MASK] were distinct from those collected in the north sea or english channel .
attempts have been made to introduce h. gammarus to new zealand , alongside other european species such as the edible crab , cancer [MASK] .
between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from [MASK] in [MASK] , but the species did not become established there .
= = ecology = =
adult h. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – [MASK] ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) .
they prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed .
the diet of h. gammarus mostly consists of other [MASK] invertebrates .
these include crabs , molluscs , sea [MASK] , [MASK] and polychaete worms .
the three [MASK] lobster species homarus gammarus , h. americanus and [MASK] [MASK] are hosts to the three known species of the animal [MASK] [MASK] ; the species on h. gammarus has not been described .
homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease [MASK] , caused by the [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .
although it is frequently found in american lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive h. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by h. americanus could not be ruled out .
= = human consumption = =
homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a [MASK] and was mentioned in " the [MASK] " a seventeenth century english folk song .
it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered .
both the claws and the abdomen of h. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible .
the exceptions are the [MASK] mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) .
the price of h. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of h. americanus , and the european species is considered to have a better flavour .
[MASK] are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines [MASK] with [MASK] or [MASK] sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand .
in 2008 , 4 , 386 t of h. gammarus were caught across europe and north africa , of which 3 , 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the british isles ( including the channel islands ) .
the minimum landing size for h. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 .
 4 in ) .
[MASK] systems for h. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .

homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of his systema [MASK] , published in 1758 .
homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus in the tenth edition of her systema [MASK] , published in 1758 .
that name was cancer gammarus , since linnaeus ' concept of the genus cancer at that time included all large crustaceans .
h. gammarus is the type species of the genus homarus weber , 1795 , as determined by direction 51 of the international commission on zoological nomenclature .
prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] , 1775 and homarus vulgaris h. milne - edwards , 1837 , and also because friedrich weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by mary [MASK] , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for homarus h. milne - edwards , 1837 ) invalid for homarus weber , 1795 .
the type specimen of homarus gammarus was a [MASK] selected by [MASK] [MASK] in 1974 .
it came from 57 ° 53 ′ n 11 ° 32 ′ e , near [MASK] , sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of gothenburg ) , but both it and the [MASK] have since been lost .
the common name for h. gammarus preferred by the food and agriculture organization is " european lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

various extensions and [MASK] have shifted the terminus as far west as new era or [MASK] in the past .
the current route was finalized in the late 1970s
= = route description = =
m - 82 begins at a junction with m - 120 and b - 96 west of [MASK] .
this junction is at a [MASK] of county lines .
m - 120 forms the north – south [MASK] – [MASK] and [MASK] – [MASK] county lines .
b - 96 , which forms the east – west [MASK] – [MASK] county line runs due west of the intersection .
m - 82 exits the intersection to the east .
the highway runs along 48th street through rural farms into the community of [MASK] .
the road , now called main street , passes through the downtown area and m - 82 turns south along stewart avenue out of town .
the highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd street running eastward through more farm land .
as the trunkline approaches [MASK] , the terrain becomes more wooded near the [MASK] river .
m - 82 follows [MASK] street east to a junction with m - 37 .
the two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on state street .
south of downtown , m - 82 turns east again , independent of m - 37 , and runs along 82nd street on the southern edge of the [MASK] national forest .
the east end of m - 82 is at exit 118 on us 131 / m - 46 west of howard city .
the michigan department of transportation ( mdot ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways .
these levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( aadt ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year .
in 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of m - 82 west of [MASK] had the peak volume for the highway at 16 , [MASK] vehicles daily .
the traffic nadir was 4 , [MASK] vehicles east of [MASK] .
in addition , mdot has not had any section of the highway listed on the national highway system , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

= = = previous designation = = =
the first usage of m - 82 was in the upper peninsula by july 1 , 1919 .
the trunkline started at m - 25 and ran north of [MASK] to the vicinity of eight mile corner .
it was later replaced by m - 48 in 1926 .
= = = current designation = = =
the current m - 82 dates back to 1926 .
it ran from us 31 in hart to the northern junction of us 131 and m - 46 in howard city .
the highway was routed through ferry , [MASK] and [MASK] , replacing m - 41 .
in late 1936 , m - 46 was extended along the section between [MASK] and howard city , forming a m - 46 / m - 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the m - 46 routing .
this concurrent section became just m - 46 in 1938 , [MASK] m - 82 back to the northern m - 37 junction in [MASK] .
the highway was moved to a new alignment west of ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 .
instead of heading northwesterly to hart , it was continued west to end in shelby .
two [MASK] in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again .
this time it was realigned to run from [MASK] to new era , bypassing ferry .
a larger change around 1969 [MASK] the highway designations in [MASK] county .
m - 20 replaced m - 82 west of [MASK] , to end at new era instead of [MASK] .
the new m - 120 designation replaced m - 20 south of [MASK] .
m - 82 now ran from [MASK] to [MASK] only .
the length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to howard city .
m - 46 was rerouted to follow the us 131 freeway south of howard city to cedar springs , and replaced m - 57 between cedar springs and [MASK] .
this freed up the [MASK] to howard city highway for a return to the m - 82 designation .
the last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with m - 120 was eliminated in favor of m - 120 .
the m - 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of [MASK] , resulting in the current highway routing .

= = history = =
previously inhabited by the [MASK] native americans , the area now called meridian was obtained by the united states under the terms of the treaty of dancing [MASK] creek in 1830 during the period of indian [MASK] .
after the treaty was ratified , european - american settlers began to move into the area .
after receiving a federal land grant of about 2 , 000 acres ( [MASK] ha ) , richard [MASK] , the first settler of meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area .
most of [MASK] 's land was bought in 1853 by lewis a.
[MASK] , a lawyer from alabama .
john t. ball , a merchant from [MASK] county , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 .
 32 km2 ) .
[MASK] and ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections .
there was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement .
ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name " meridian , " believing the term to be synonymous with " junction " ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " [MASK] " ( meaning " mad river " in a native american language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and [MASK] proposed " [MASK] city . "
ball erected a station house on the mobile and ohio railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " meridian " and " [MASK] " each day .
eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " meridian " on the station permanently .
the town was officially incorporated as meridian on february 10 , 1860 .
meridian was a small village at the start of the american civil war in 1861 .

the town [MASK] in the aftermath of the civil war , and experienced its " golden age " from 1880 to 1910 .
the railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom .
as the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area .
between 1890 and 1930 , meridian was the largest city in mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the south .
many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the grand opera house in 1890 , the [MASK] school in 1894 , two carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the [MASK] building , meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 .
the city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s .
even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following great depression , the city continued to attract new businesses .
with [MASK] becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the depression , the s. h. kress & co. building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown meridian , as did the temple theater , which was used as a movie house .
the federal [MASK] was built in 1933 as a [MASK] project .
after a brief [MASK] of the economy at the end of the depression , the country entered world war ii , which renewed the importance of railroads .
the rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so meridian became the region 's rail center again .
this renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and interstate highway system became more popular than passenger rails .
the decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas .
during the american civil rights movement in the 1960s , meridian was home to a council of [MASK] [MASK] ( [MASK] ) office and several other activist organizations .
james [MASK] and other local residents , along with michael [MASK] , his wife rita , and andrew goodman , volunteers from the north , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare african americans in the area to regain the power to vote .

whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence .
in june 1964 , [MASK] , [MASK] , and goodman went to [MASK] county , mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned .
the three disappeared that night on their way back to meridian .
following a massive fbi investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam .
seven [MASK] , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal [MASK] in meridian of " [MASK] the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the mississippi civil rights workers murders trial .
it was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing . "
in 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time .
edgar ray [MASK] was convicted of [MASK] and sentenced to 60 years in prison .
meridian later honored [MASK] by renaming a portion of 49th avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service .

starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made [MASK] easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north .
after strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city .
the meridian historic [MASK] and landmarks commission was created in 1979 , and the meridian main street program was founded in 1985 .
meridian main street organized several projects to [MASK] downtown , including the construction of a new amtrak station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during meridian 's golden age ; it had been demolished .
other projects included the renovation of the [MASK] building in 2001 and [MASK] 's restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design .
meridian main street , along with the riley foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic grand opera house in 2006 for use as the " mississippi state university riley center for education and the performing arts . "
after ownership of the meridian main street was transferred to the alliance for downtown meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the meridian downtown association , spearheaded the downtown [MASK] effort .
the alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations .
plans were underway to renovate the [MASK] building , but newly elected mayor [MASK] barry killed the plans in early 2010 .
today , the alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night .
the meridian downtown association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the meridian main street program supports existing businesses downtown .
= = = hotels = = =
given meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels .
even before meridian reached its " golden age , " several large hotels , including the great southern and the grand avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century .
with the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original union station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers .
the [MASK] hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the terminal hotel was constructed in 1910 .
hotel meridian was constructed in 1907 , and union hotel was built in 1908 .
union hotel was listed on the national register of historic places in 1979 , and both hotel meridian and grand avenue hotel were listed as contributing properties to the meridian urban center historic district .
as the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven - story skyscraper lamar hotel built in 1927 .
listed on the national register of historic places in 1979 , the lamar hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building .
in 1988 it was listed as a mississippi landmark .
the [MASK] young hotel was built in 1931 .
a staple in the african - american business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling african american could find a room .
as the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown .
[MASK] of the riley center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel .
the [MASK] building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations .
the [MASK] preservation society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .

= = education = =
early public education in meridian was based on the 1870 mississippi constitution .
from 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the city council served on the board of school directors , which had authority to operate the schools .
although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students .
the city did not build its first publicly owned school until september 1884 .
the first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from st. paul methodist church .
the mississippi legislature amended the city charter in january 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in march of the same year $ 30 , 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools .
from this bond , the [MASK] school was built in 1894 , becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks .
from this early district and later additions , the meridian public school district grew to its current size , which now includes six elementary schools , 3 middle schools , and 3 high schools .
the city also contains several private schools including lamar school , [MASK] christian school , community christian school , and st. patrick 's catholic school .
the campus of meridian high school , the main high school in the district , occupies 37 acres ( 15 ha ) , including six buildings and 111 classrooms .
the school is made up of grades 10 - 12 and [MASK] approximately 1 , 500 students .

after [MASK] laws were passed , [MASK] merged with [MASK] harris junior college in 1970 , which had previously enrolled african - american students .

meridian is served by the meridian - lauderdale county public library , located at the corner of 7th street and 26th avenue .
the city originally had two carnegie libraries , both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites .
a group of women had formed the [MASK] book and magazine club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city .
the books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for meridian .
with wide support for the library , the club enlisted israel marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist andrew carnegie for funding assistance .
the library for blacks was built at 13th street and 28th avenue on land donated by st. paul methodist church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the first presbyterian church of meridian , who sold it to the city on september 25 , 1911 .
the african american library was the only library for blacks in the state until after world war i and is the only carnegie library ever built for african americans in the country .
the two libraries served the city until 1967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the civil rights act of 1964 , combined their collections , and moved all materials to their current location .
the former white library was renovated and converted into the meridian museum of art in 1970 , and the former african - american library was demolished on may 28 , 2008 .

the island has several neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of duke [MASK] 's 13th - century house dating from the norse occupation of the island .
the population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at [MASK] in west [MASK] .

much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow [MASK] soil that may be derived from glacial till .
there is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile .

by the 18th century , two scottish [MASK] , thomas [MASK] of [MASK] , and arthur [MASK] of [MASK] , owned the island .
they maintained a prosperous [MASK] ( old norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six - [MASK] boats known as [MASK] .
in addition to the [MASK] colony on [MASK] [MASK] there may have been another at [MASK] [MASK] overlooking [MASK] [MASK] .

it is called the ' [MASK] [MASK] ' by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as " the site of a [MASK] chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " .
there is a tradition that the work there was [MASK] with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night .
eventually the [MASK] were moved overnight by these [MASK] agencies to the present site of the church and work was re - commenced there successfully .

so when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' angel of death ' came from . "
the lyrics detail [MASK] 's surgical experiments on patients at the auschwitz concentration camp during world war ii .
[MASK] 's [MASK] were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations .

the song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied .

= high five interchange =
the high five interchange is one of the first five - level stack interchanges built in dallas , texas .
located at the junction of the lyndon b. johnson freeway ( interstate 635 , i - 635 ) and the central expressway ( us highway 75 , us 75 ) , it replaces an [MASK] partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s .
the $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in december 2005 .
it was designed by the [MASK] corporation and built by [MASK] construction corporation .
the interchange is considered by popular [MASK] to be one of " the world 's 18 [MASK] [MASK] " because of its height ( as high as a 12 - story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
in 2006 , the american public works association named the high five interchange as " public works [MASK] of the year " .
= = description = =
the high five interchange , north of downtown in dallas , texas , is a massive five - level freeway interchange .
it is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the lyndon b. johnson freeway ( interstate 635 ) and the central expressway ( us 75 ) , and is the first five - level stack interchange to be built in the city .
it replaces the [MASK] three - level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing us 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways .
the looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic .
left - hand exits contributed to the congestion .
further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult .
[MASK] to the celebratory gesture , the " high five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left - turn movements that tower over the landscape .
the interchange is as high as a 12 - story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " high five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway .
the highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground .
the lanes of us 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top as part of the project , i - 635 was widened to include four dedicated high - occupancy vehicle lanes ( [MASK] lanes ) that are barrier - separated and [MASK] .
the roads on the five levels are :
level i : us 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way
level ii : the junction of the two six - lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left - turn lanes and [MASK] , and easy access to us 75 and i - 635
level iii : i - 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four [MASK] lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers
level iv and v : direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf
the interchange , with its decorative [MASK] on [MASK] concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the texas department of transportation ( [MASK] ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art .
the high five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the [MASK] trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange .
the section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the high five project by [MASK] .
the interchange is considered by popular [MASK] as one of " the world 's 18 [MASK] [MASK] " , calling it a " labyrinth of lanes " and a " five - level [MASK] of engineering " because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
= = history = =
the high five interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , [MASK] interchange that accommodated 500 , 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in dallas .
it was a collaborative project between the [MASK] , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , [MASK] construction .
an essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible .
reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access .
[MASK] construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by [MASK] , the largest ever by that agency .
the construction contract for the high five interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts .
for example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time [MASK] had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a [MASK] scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years .
also built into the construction contract was a provision that [MASK] was charged for " lane rentals " by [MASK] for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on [MASK] assessments and the time of day the lane was closed .
the fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 , 000 for rush hours .
in order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and [MASK] so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed .
little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished .
to save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : the original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct - connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast - in - place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans .
however , [MASK] decided to use [MASK] concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by deal [MASK] of italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place .
during the construction , 2 .
 2 million cubic yards of [MASK] was used , 350 , 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 , 000 square feet of retaining walls were built .
additionally , 40 , 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 , 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed .

= [MASK] creek mountains =
the [MASK] creek mountains are a remote , semi - arid great basin mountain range mostly in southeastern oregon and partially in northern nevada in the united states .
the range 's highest point is [MASK] view [MASK] , 8 , [MASK] feet ( 2 , 593 m ) above sea level , in nevada .
disaster peak , elevation 7 , [MASK] feet ( 2 , 372 m ) , is another prominent summit in the nevada portion of the mountains .
the mountains are characteristic of the great basin 's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys .
[MASK] generally north to south , the [MASK] creek mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other [MASK] , on top of older [MASK] rocks .
the southern end of the range , however , features many [MASK] [MASK] .
as a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by [MASK] and canyons .
most of the range is public land administered by the federal bureau of land management .
there is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and [MASK] are the primary human uses — but former mines at the [MASK] [MASK] produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in north america in the 20th century .
public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited .
[MASK] includes large [MASK] of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands .
sage grouse and mountain [MASK] are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include [MASK] and jackrabbits .
despite the area 's dry climate , a few year - round streams provide habitat for the rare [MASK] [MASK] trout .
fish populations in the [MASK] creek mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century .
in the 1980s , the effects of grazing [MASK] on riparian zones and the fish led to land - use conflict .
the [MASK] creek mountain working group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties .
the [MASK] met and agreed on changes to land - use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .
= = geography = =
the [MASK] creek mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern oregon and northern nevada , in harney and humboldt counties .
the nearest human settlements are the [MASK] ranch , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle of the mountains ; fields , oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; [MASK] , nevada , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west ; and [MASK] , nevada – oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east .
the mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest of boise , idaho , and about 190 miles ( 310 km ) northeast of [MASK] , nevada .
the range and surrounding non - mountainous areas cover an area of [MASK] square miles ( 2 , 100 km2 ) .
the mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west .
more of the range is in oregon ( 78 % ) than in nevada ( 22 % ) .
the highest point in the range is [MASK] view [MASK] , which is 8 , [MASK] feet ( 2 , 593 m ) above sea level and is located in nevada about one mile south of the oregon border .
about two miles southeast of [MASK] view is disaster peak , " a large , symmetrical [MASK] that is visible throughout the region . "
at 7 , [MASK] feet ( 2 , 372 m ) , disaster peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub - range called the [MASK] .
the oregon canyon mountains border the [MASK] creek mountains on the east along the harney – [MASK] county line ( according to the united states geological survey 's definitions ) , while the [MASK] mountains are the next range west of the [MASK] creek mountains .
the [MASK] creek mountains in both oregon and nevada border the [MASK] creek mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by [MASK] cabin creek and south fork [MASK] creek .
south of the [MASK] creek mountains is the kings river valley , which separates the [MASK] creek mountains on the west from the montana mountains on the east .
the terrain in the [MASK] creek mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock [MASK] cut by deep canyons .
the canyons have steep walls with loose [MASK] slopes at the [MASK] .
there are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year - round .
major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) [MASK] creek , [MASK] creek , [MASK] creek , and [MASK] creek .
these streams all flow into [MASK] basins in harney county , oregon .
[MASK] creek and [MASK] creek are the largest of the four .
the kings river and [MASK] creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the [MASK] creek mountains .
the kings river begins in the [MASK] and flows south into nevada , where it meets the quinn river , which [MASK] in the black rock desert .
[MASK] creek begins in oregon a few miles north of the [MASK] and flows generally east , crossing the oregon – nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the quinn river valley south of [MASK] .
= = geology = =
the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin of the western united states , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high - desert valleys .
the [MASK] creek mountains are [MASK] and [MASK] blocks with steep [MASK] along the southern and eastern sides of the range .
the southern area of the range , known as the [MASK] , has numerous [MASK] of cretaceous age granite .
these granite [MASK] are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic [MASK] .
the [MASK] creek mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where [MASK] mountain is today .
[MASK] thinning and the yellowstone [MASK] , which was then beneath southeastern oregon , induced eruptions from [MASK] and nearby [MASK] about 17 million years ago , in the miocene .
the [MASK] produced a series of [MASK] flows that spread across the land now known as the [MASK] creek mountains .
[MASK] from the [MASK] volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate [MASK] flows occurred .
under the resulting basalt rock lie much older [MASK] rocks that may be related to some of the [MASK] age formations of the blue mountains in northeastern oregon .
within these [MASK] rocks are [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] bodies which were presumably [MASK] during the cretaceous period .
the broad [MASK] [MASK] is a prominent geologic feature in the [MASK] creek mountains .
the oval - shaped [MASK] is a collapsed [MASK] dome that [MASK] the oregon – nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the oregon canyon mountains .
it is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide .
the [MASK] dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early miocene .
a total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large [MASK] dome structure .
the [MASK] formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago .
the [MASK] contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the [MASK] .
other areas in the [MASK] were mined for ores of antimony , [MASK] , and lithium .
= = climate = =
the [MASK] creek mountains are semi - arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west .
when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the [MASK] creek mountains .
as a result , the average annual precipitation in the [MASK] creek mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually .
much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of march and the end of june .
most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months .
[MASK] at elevations below 6 , 000 feet ( 1 , 800 m ) usually [MASK] by april ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid - june .
local flooding often occurs in the spring as the [MASK] [MASK] .
the prevailing winds are from the west - southwest , and they are normally strongest in march and april .
[MASK] , intense thunderstorms are common between april and october .
[MASK] in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .
= = ecology = =
= = = flora = = =
[MASK] in the [MASK] creek mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses .
other common shrubs include [MASK] , snowberry , and [MASK] .
there are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas .
common grass species include idaho [MASK] , bluebunch wheatgrass , [MASK] , western [MASK] , [MASK] 's [MASK] , [MASK] 's [MASK] , and [MASK] [MASK] , as well as basin [MASK] in some well - drained areas .
less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian [MASK] ( vegetation along stream banks ) .
however , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem .
the meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping [MASK] or in stream [MASK] , and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 .
 40 to 2 .
 02 ha ) .
[MASK] riparian [MASK] follow the year - round streams .
many [MASK] areas have [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] groves .
[MASK] and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is [MASK] and stream channels are wider .
[MASK] and rushes are also native to these stream [MASK] .
years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young [MASK] and [MASK] trees .
restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s .
however , large [MASK] in southeastern oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle .

animals in the [MASK] creek mountains are adapted to the environment of the high desert .
[MASK] are common in the open , sagebrush - covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and [MASK] groves .
there are also [MASK] sheep , cougars , and [MASK] in the high country .
jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range .
mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they [MASK] the great basin .
some other mammals include the northern pocket [MASK] , mountain [MASK] , and [MASK] 's ground [MASK] .
north american [MASK] live in and along streams , as do pacific tree frogs , western [MASK] toads , and [MASK] snakes .
native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain [MASK] , gray - headed [MASK] , black - throated gray [MASK] , virginia 's [MASK] , [MASK] 's [MASK] , pine [MASK] , red [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] thrush , northern [MASK] , and species of [MASK] and eagle .
several streams in the [MASK] creek mountains are home to trout , including the rare [MASK] [MASK] trout subspecies .
these include [MASK] creek , [MASK] creek , little [MASK] creek , [MASK] creek , fifteen mile creek , indian creek , sage canyon creek , line canyon creek , and some tributaries of [MASK] creek .
[MASK] [MASK] trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the [MASK] creek mountains .
these populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation .
for most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably .
it was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 .
reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , [MASK] , competition with other fish , and [MASK] with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure [MASK] [MASK] trout .
however , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .
= = human uses = =
the bureau of land management ( [MASK] ) administers most land in the [MASK] creek mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area .
the private lands are mainly used for [MASK] along mountain streams , while the [MASK] lands include large grazing [MASK] for local ranchers ' cattle .
at least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration .
commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the [MASK] [MASK] , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted .
[MASK] in what was called the [MASK] [MASK] district produced 270 , 000 [MASK] of mercury — " the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere " — from [MASK] extracted from the [MASK] in the 20th century .
the two leading mercury - producing mines in north america were the [MASK] and [MASK] mines on the edge of the [MASK] in nevada .
together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 .
the [MASK] mine , the last mercury mine in the united states , closed three years later , in 1992 .
however , mineral exploration has continued at the [MASK] mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of [MASK] as part of a u.s. environmental protection agency [MASK] project .
the entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness - like experience .
[MASK] , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities .
the only developed recreation site nearby is at [MASK] creek hot springs , just south of the [MASK] ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four - wheel off - road vehicles .
hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , [MASK] , [MASK] , and rabbits .
[MASK] on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch - and - release basis .
the mountains are also suitable for hiking cross - country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek [MASK] .
there are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by northern [MASK] people as long as 7 , 000 years ago .
[MASK] grazing in the [MASK] creek mountains began in the late 19th century , and the [MASK] currently [MASK] grazing [MASK] in the area .
[MASK] can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months .
the effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s .
= = land - management compromise = =
by the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the [MASK] creek mountains and elsewhere in the great basin .
as a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones .
[MASK] populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures .
these conditions put the rare [MASK] [MASK] trout population at risk .
since the [MASK] was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the [MASK] creek mountains .
beginning in the early 1970s , the bureau of land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas .
approximately 20 , 000 [MASK] trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing .
next , the agency sought to reform land - use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project .
as environmentalists pressed the [MASK] to close much of the [MASK] creek mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the [MASK] rebellion seeking to protect their grazing [MASK] .
initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades .
however , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the [MASK] creek mountain working group .
the group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs .
initial members of the [MASK] creek mountain working group included :
over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers .
meetings were all open to the public .
the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well - being of ranchers .
in 1989 , the [MASK] ranch agreed to rest two grazing [MASK] totaling 50 , 000 acres ( 20 , 000 ha ) to restore critical stream [MASK] and mountain pastures .
the [MASK] 's [MASK] on fifteen mile creek was rested for three years , and its [MASK] creek pasture received a five - year rest before grazing was resumed .
in addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the [MASK] areas was reduced from 3 , 800 to 2 , 200 .
finally , sensitive areas were [MASK] to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams .
other [MASK] also agreed to rest specific pastures including the [MASK] creek , [MASK] creek , and [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .
in 1991 , the bureau of land management approved a new grazing [MASK] management plan .
it was based on the agreements made by the [MASK] creek mountain working group , and it took effect in 1992 .
since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the [MASK] creek mountains has recovered , and studies by the united states fish and wildlife service have found that the [MASK] [MASK] trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .

= capel [MASK] =
capel [MASK] ( sometimes referred to as hen [MASK] [MASK] ) is a ruined chapel near [MASK] [MASK] in anglesey , north wales , dating back to the first half of the 12th century .
the chapel 's original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population .
it was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair .
the walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof .
it contains a 16th - century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber .
it is a grade ii listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is " a substantially 12th - century structure " with the " unusual 16th - century vaulted south chapel " .
= = history and location = =
the oldest parts of capel [MASK] date from the first half of the 12th century .
this was a time when many churches on anglesey in north - west wales were first built in stone following the end of viking raids and attempts by the [MASK] to gain control of the island .
the reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown .
geraint jones , author of a 2006 guide to the churches of anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby .
[MASK] and [MASK] , authors of a 2001 guide to ancient anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of [MASK] [MASK] and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times .
despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right .
the chapel is sometimes referred to as " hen [MASK] [MASK] " ( " hen " being the welsh word for " old " and " [MASK] " meaning " chapel " ) .
the walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time .
a chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century .
a vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the pierce [MASK] .
in 1999 , the vault was used to record some " atmospheres " for the album " you have just been [MASK] by the [MASK] " by the [MASK] , a collective of welsh musicians including members of echo and the [MASK] , super [MASK] animals and [MASK] that was described by one journalist as " possibly the [MASK] pop group of all time " .
for a time , capel [MASK] was used as a private place of worship for [MASK] house , a " venerable mansion " once owned by the lloyd family which came into the possession of william [MASK] , 1st baron boston , in the 18th century .
after the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair .
the walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone .

[MASK] [MASK] b ( abbreviated [MASK] [MASK] b , [MASK] and b ) , occasionally designated [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf [MASK] [MASK] b ) , also named [MASK] , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light - years away from the sun in the constellation of [MASK] .
the planet orbits the solar twin star , [MASK] [MASK] a , approximately every five days .
discovered in june 1996 by geoffrey [MASK] and r. paul butler , it was one of the first hot jupiters to be discovered .
it is also one of the first non - resolved planets to be detected directly .
[MASK] [MASK] b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system .
in july 2014 the international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars .
the process involved public nomination and voting for the new names .
in december 2015 , the iau announced the winning name was [MASK] for this planet .
the winning name was submitted by the vega [MASK] club of morocco and honours the 11th century astronomer ibn al - [MASK] of muslim spain .
= = discovery = =
like the majority of known extrasolar planets , [MASK] [MASK] b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity .
the variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the [MASK] shift of [MASK] [MASK] 's spectrum .
the planet 's existence was announced in january 1997 , together with 55 [MASK] b and the planet orbiting [MASK] [MASK] .
like 51 [MASK] b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , [MASK] [MASK] b orbits very close to its star , closer than mercury does to our sun .
the planet takes 4 .
 [MASK] days to complete an orbit , with a [MASK] axis of 0 .
 [MASK] au .
a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect [MASK] [MASK] b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found .
in the case of [MASK] [MASK] b , this lower limit is 68 .
 7 % of the mass of jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater .
however , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 .
 4 mj .
[MASK] is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees .
= = physical characteristics = =
given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that [MASK] [MASK] b is a gas giant with no solid surface .
the [MASK] space telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of [MASK] [MASK] b of about 1 , 400 degrees [MASK] , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 , 400 to 1 , 650 degrees [MASK] .
the temperature difference has led to speculation that [MASK] [MASK] b is [MASK] locked with the same side always facing [MASK] [MASK] a.
[MASK] had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted [MASK] [MASK] b to have reflective clouds of [MASK] and iron in its upper atmosphere .
the cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a [MASK] of cooler gas .
the outer shell of dark , [MASK] , hot cloud is assumed to consist of [MASK] and [MASK] oxides ( " [MASK] planets " ) , but other compounds like [MASK] cannot be ruled out yet .
the planet is unlikely to have large moons , since [MASK] forces would either [MASK] them from orbit or destroy them on short [MASK] compared to the age of the system .
the planet ( with 51 [MASK] b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by [MASK] .
preliminary results from [MASK] studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 .
 36 times as large and 0 .
 74 times as massive as jupiter , meaning that the mean density is [MASK] / cm3 .
it has a [MASK] albedo of 0 .

[MASK] [MASK] b appears to be responsible for increased [MASK] activity on its parent star .
observations suggest that there is a " hot spot " on the star around 169 ° away from the sub - planetary point .
this may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star .
the mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] variable stars , or the interaction between jupiter and its moon io .

" ... thirteen years later " is the second episode of millennium to have been written by michael r. perry , who had previously penned the second season episode " the [MASK] " , and would provide a further three scripts in the third season .
the episode was directed by thomas j. wright , who helmed a total of twenty - six episodes across all three seasons .
wright would also go on to direct " millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show the x - files .
the episode features guest appearances by the members of the band kiss — peter criss , ace [MASK] , gene simmons and paul stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role .
however , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and [MASK] updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode .
ace [MASK] was also [MASK] towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 - pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 eddie murphy film the [MASK] professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to [MASK] .

perry has described the production " ... thirteen years later " as being " one of the most [MASK] " of the series ' run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this .
perry praised wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode .

between the southern terminus and i - 95 , the route is a mix of freeway and four - lane divided highway that runs along the delaware river through [MASK] .
this section includes a truck - restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and [MASK] cemetery .
north of i - 95 , route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two - lane highway .
north of the south [MASK] tunnel , it is designated the delaware river scenic byway , a new jersey scenic byway and national scenic byway , that follows the delaware river in mostly rural sections of mercer county and [MASK] county .
the obsolete delaware & [MASK] canal usually stands between the river and the highway .
most sections of this portion of route 29 are completely [MASK] due to the tree canopy .
route 29 also has a spur , route 129 , which connects route 29 to u.s. route 1 ( us 1 ) in [MASK] .
route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown [MASK] to newark , following present - day route 179 and us 202 between [MASK] and [MASK] and us 22 between [MASK] and newark .
the route between [MASK] and frenchtown was originally route [MASK] .
in 1953 , route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of route [MASK] to avoid the [MASK] with the u.s.

route 29 between south warren street in [MASK] and i - 95 in ewing township was upgraded to a four - lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s .
in 1995 , the southern freeway part of route 29 between i - 195 / i - 295 and route 129 in hamilton township was completed .
this freeway section was linked to the rest of route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 .

= = history = =
the current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the delaware river drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the delaware river from [MASK] to the new york border in [MASK] township .
route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from [MASK] to newark .
the original route ran from downtown [MASK] along state street and [MASK] drive .
from there , it followed its current alignment to [MASK] , where it followed present - day route 179 to [MASK] to present - day county route [MASK] , which it followed to woods tavern .
the route turned north on u.s. route 206 ( also designated route 31 ) and followed that route to [MASK] , where it followed u.s. route 22 to newark .
the current alignment of route 29 from [MASK] to route 12 in frenchtown was designated route [MASK] in 1927 .
the alignment of route 29 between [MASK] and [MASK] was eventually shifted to follow present - day u.s. route 202 , which was also route 30 ( now route 31 ) between [MASK] and flemington and route 12 between flemington and [MASK] .
in 1938 , route [MASK] was planned as an extension of route [MASK] from frenchtown to route 28 ( now route 122 ) in alpha .
while this road was never built , much of the alignment north of milford is served by county route [MASK] .
in 1948 , a spur route , route [MASK] , was created , running along u.s. route 202 ( bridge street ) in [MASK] to the new hope - [MASK] bridge .
in the 1953 new jersey state highway renumbering , route 29 was [MASK] to continue north from [MASK] to frenchtown on route [MASK] , and the route 29 designation between [MASK] and newark was removed in favor of u.s. route 202 between [MASK] and [MASK] and u.s. route 22 between [MASK] and newark .
the section of former route 29 between route [MASK] and route [MASK] became route 165 .
plans for a limited - access route along the route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the delaware river between [MASK] and [MASK] ; this proposal never materialized .
plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the john fitch parkway , that was to run from hamilton township to interstate 95 in ewing township .
this road was built between 1954 and 1957 from south warren street in [MASK] to present - day interstate 95 in ewing township .
construction of this portion john fitch parkway took up much of [MASK] ’ s available waterfront along the delaware river .
the former alignment of route 29 in the northern part of [MASK] and in ewing township became route 175 .
between 1990 and 1995 , the route 29 freeway was built between the interstate 195 / interstate 295 interchange and route 129 in hamilton township .
a two - lane street , [MASK] road , connected the two freeway sections .
plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in [MASK] .
construction began in 1997 on the route 29 freeway between route 129 and the [MASK] - [MASK] railroad bridge .
the road was to include two traffic lights at cass street and south warren street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the delaware river .
the tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the army corps of engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel .
the roof was put in place in october 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on march 2 , 2002 .
a restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in november 2002 .
by the 2000s , the state gave the part of route 29 ( south main street ) between route 165 and route 179 in [MASK] to the city , and route 29 was rerouted to use all of route 165 and one block of route 179 .
prior to this , south main street had been turned one - way southbound .
route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with route 29 .

the first [MASK] invasions of burma ( [MASK] ) ( [MASK] : [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] – [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] ( [MASK] – [MASK] ) ) were a series of military conflicts between [MASK] khan 's yuan dynasty , division of the [MASK] empire , and the pagan empire that took place between [MASK] and [MASK] .

two dry season campaigns ( [MASK] – 85 ) later , the mongols had occupied down to [MASK] and [MASK] , forcing the [MASK] king to flee to lower burma .
the mongols organized northern burma as the province of [MASK] .
[MASK] negotiations began in [MASK] , and ended with [MASK] finally agreeing to submit in june [MASK] .
the [MASK] embassy , received by the emperor in beijing in january [MASK] , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the [MASK] of the yuan dynasty or the [MASK] empire over the pagan empire and annual payments in taxes to the [MASK] government in exchange for the evacuation of [MASK] troops from northern burma .
but the treaty never really took effect as [MASK] was assassinated in july [MASK] , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged .
the [MASK] command at [MASK] now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central burma .
they may not have reached pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to [MASK] .
the pagan empire [MASK] and anarchy ensued .
the mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years .

in the 13th century , the pagan empire , along with the khmer empire , was one of the two main empires in mainland southeast asia .
for much of its history , pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent [MASK] kingdom and its predecessor [MASK] , both with [MASK] as their capital city .
[MASK] - based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times [MASK] themselves with the [MASK] empire to their west and at other times with china 's tang and song dynasties .
indeed , [MASK] 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of pagan and the pagan dynasty itself .
between the newly conquered [MASK] territory and pagan were a wide [MASK] of [MASK] stretching from present - day [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] prefectures in [MASK] as well as the [MASK] and [MASK] regions ( presumably in present - day northern shan state ) , which pagan and [MASK] had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence .

the arrival of the mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the [MASK] as the mongols were intent on finishing off the song .
for the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from china to burma and india .

by then , the pagan empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century .

although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in [MASK] – 60 in south [MASK] and [MASK] ( [MASK] ) , the decline continued .

the king was furious at the demand and kept the [MASK] envoys waiting for weeks .
the court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king .

though it was ultimately under [MASK] command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were [MASK] - speaking peoples or people from the further west : turks from [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] , but also captive soldiers from the persian [MASK] empire , the [MASK] , and even [MASK] from the lower [MASK] .

what followed was a border war in [MASK] – 78 .

according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo 's accounts , a [MASK] army " invaded " the [MASK] territory of gold [MASK] , and was defeated by the [MASK] army in april [MASK] .
the battle took place either at the [MASK] valley ( in present - day [MASK] prefecture ) or 110 km southwest at [MASK] ( present - day [MASK] , [MASK] prefecture ) , which the [MASK] called [MASK] .
the yuan chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a [MASK] army of 40 , 000 to 50 , 000 with 10 , 000 horses and 800 [MASK] .
it also reports only one [MASK] was killed , in trying to catch an elephant .
according to marco polo , the [MASK] army consisted of 12 , 000 mounted [MASK] , and the [MASK] army numbered 60 , 000 men with 2000 [MASK] , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well - framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well - armed fighting men . "
even then , the 40 , 000 to 60 , 000 figures of the [MASK] army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the mongols may have [MASK] " on the side of generosity " not to " [MASK] their glory in defeating superior numbers . "
according to marco polo 's account , in the early stages of the battle , the turkish and [MASK] horsemen " took such [MASK] at the sight of the [MASK] that they would not be got to face the [MASK] , but always [MASK] and turned back , " while the [MASK] forces pressed on .

throughout [MASK] , the [MASK] command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of [MASK] and northern burma .
the objective of the burma campaign was to take over northern burma but no further ; the emperor did not [MASK] an attack on pagan itself .
at least one army consisted of 14 , 000 men of the [MASK] persian [MASK] empire under the command of [MASK] [MASK] was sent to [MASK] to reinforce the burma invasion force , which again was made up of turks and other central [MASK] .

given the chaos , the governor of [MASK] ignored the imperial orders of evacuation .
the [MASK] army commanded by prince [MASK] - sin [MASK] , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward pagan .
according to mainstream traditional ( british colonial era ) scholarship , the [MASK] army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out [MASK] to receive homage , one of which reached south of [MASK] .
but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary [MASK] / chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of pagan or the temporary [MASK] of the conquest .
recent research shows that the [MASK] forces most probably never reached pagan .
they were held at bay by the [MASK] defenses led by commanders [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of pagan .
( an inscription dated 16 february [MASK] by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the [MASK] army . )

the real power in central burma now rested with the three commander brothers .
the uneasy arrangement would persist until [MASK] .
the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to [MASK] as the province of [MASK] ( [MASK] - [MASK] ) but ended the fictional central burma province of [MASK] on 18 august [MASK] .
meanwhile , the power struggle in central burma continued with the three brothers [MASK] consolidating support .
to check their rising power , [MASK] submitted to the mongols in january [MASK] , and was recognized by the yuan emperor [MASK] khan as king of pagan on 20 march [MASK] .
the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of [MASK] .
the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power .
on 17 december [MASK] , the three brothers [MASK] [MASK] , and founded the [MASK] kingdom .
the [MASK] forced the [MASK] government to intervene again , leading to the second [MASK] invasion of burma ( 1300 – 01 ) .

the war was one of several near simultaneous wars [MASK] by the [MASK] empire and the yuan dynasty in the late 13th century .
though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in burma .
the invasions [MASK] in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of tai - shan states throughout mainland southeast asia .
= = = age of political fragmentation = = =
the immediate result of the war was the collapse of the pagan empire .
however , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it .
pagan 's disintegration was " in fact more prolonged and [MASK] . "
the kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century .
had pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” .
but the dynasty could not recover , and because the mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath .
as a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century .
it was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the [MASK] basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy .
the vast region surrounding the [MASK] valley would continue to be made up of several small tai - shan states well into the 16th century .
= = = rise of tai - shan states = = =
perhaps the most enduring legacy of the [MASK] invasions was the emergence of tai - shan states in mainland southeast asia .
the tai - shan people who came down with the [MASK] invasions stayed .
by the early 14th century , several tai - shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present - day [MASK] to northern and eastern [MASK] to northern and central thailand and laos .
their rise was encouraged by the mongols , who viewed the states as a useful [MASK] between [MASK] and the rest of southeast asia .
the mongols , who were still trying to incorporate [MASK] into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of [MASK] into the fold .
( the integration of [MASK] itself into “ china [MASK] ” was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . )
as such , from the newly formed tai - shan states in western and central southeast asia to dai viet and [MASK] in eastern southeast asia , the mongols elected to receive nominal tribute .
though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the yuan government , they were the native chieftains , “ who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased .

the battle of [MASK] 's ridge , also known as the battle of the bloody ridge , battle of raiders ridge , and battle of the ridge , was a land battle of the pacific campaign of world war ii between imperial japanese army and allied ( mainly united states marine corps ) ground forces .
it took place from 12 – 14 september 1942 , on [MASK] in the solomon islands , and was the second of three separate major japanese ground offensives during the [MASK] campaign .
in the battle , u.s. marines , under the overall command of u.s. major general alexander [MASK] , repulsed an attack by the japanese 35th infantry brigade , under the command of japanese major general [MASK] [MASK] .
the marines were defending the [MASK] perimeter that guarded henderson field on [MASK] , which was captured from the japanese by the allies in landings on [MASK] on 7 august 1942 .
[MASK] 's unit was sent to [MASK] in response to the allied landings with the mission of [MASK] the airfield and driving the allied forces from the island .
[MASK] the strength of allied forces on [MASK] – about 12 , 000 – [MASK] 's 6 , 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the u.s. defenses .

[MASK] .
although the marine defenses were almost overrun , [MASK] 's attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the japanese .
because of the key participation by [MASK] 's unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as " [MASK] 's " ridge in historical accounts of the battle in western sources .
after [MASK] 's ridge , the japanese continued to send troops to [MASK] for further attempts to retake henderson field , affecting japanese offensive operations in other areas of the south pacific .

on 7 august 1942 , allied forces ( primarily u.s. ) landed on [MASK] , [MASK] , and florida islands in the solomon islands .
the landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the u.s. and australia .
they were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major japanese base at rabaul and support the allied new guinea campaign .
the landings initiated the six - month - long [MASK] campaign .
taking the japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 august the allied landing forces had secured [MASK] and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at [MASK] point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ s 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ e ) on the north shore of the island of [MASK] east of the present day capital of [MASK] .

[MASK] placed her 11 , 000 troops of the 1st marine division on [MASK] in a loose perimeter around the [MASK] point area .
on 12 august , the airfield was named henderson field after major [MASK] henderson , a marine [MASK] who had been killed at the battle of midway .
the allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of henderson field were called the " [MASK] air force " after the allied code name for [MASK] .
in response to the allied landings on [MASK] , the japanese imperial general headquarters assigned the imperial japanese army 's 17th army — a corps - sized command based at rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ s 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ e ) and under the command of lieutenant - general [MASK] [MASK] — with the task of retaking [MASK] from allied forces .
the 17th army — heavily involved with the japanese campaign in new guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern [MASK] area .
of these units , the 35th infantry brigade — under major general [MASK] [MASK] — was at [MASK] , the 4th ( [MASK] ) infantry regiment was in the philippines and the 28th ( [MASK] ) infantry regiment — under the command of colonel [MASK] [MASK] — was embarked on transport ships near guam .
the different units began to move toward [MASK] immediately ; [MASK] 's regiment — the closest — arrived first .
the " first [MASK] " of [MASK] 's unit — consisting of about [MASK] soldiers — landed from destroyers at [MASK] point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ s 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ e ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the [MASK] perimeter , on august 19 .

the survivors returned to [MASK] point , notified 17th army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from rabaul .
by 23 august , [MASK] 's unit had reached [MASK] and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to [MASK] .
because of the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle of the eastern [MASK] , the japanese decided not to deliver [MASK] 's troops to [MASK] by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying [MASK] 's soldiers were sent to rabaul .
from there , the japanese planned to deliver [MASK] 's men to [MASK] by destroyers , staging through a japanese naval base in the [MASK] islands .
the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down " the [MASK] " to [MASK] and back in a single night , [MASK] their exposure to allied air attack .
however , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to [MASK] with them .
these high - speed destroyer runs to [MASK] , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the " tokyo express " by allied forces and " rat transportation " by the japanese .
the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies .
however , any japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range of the aircraft at henderson field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks .
this " curious tactical situation " held for several months .

at 18 : 05 that day , 11 u.s. dive bombers from [MASK] - 232 under the command of lt. col. richard [MASK] , flew from henderson field and located and attacked [MASK] about 70 mi ( 110 km ) north of [MASK] , sinking [MASK] and heavily damaging [MASK] and [MASK] .
[MASK] took [MASK] in tow and the three destroyers returned to the [MASK] without completing their mission .
the attack on [MASK] killed 62 of [MASK] 's soldiers and 94 crew members .
subsequent " express " runs were more successful .
between 29 august and 4 september , various japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 , 000 troops at [MASK] point , including all of the 35th infantry brigade , one battalion of the [MASK] regiment , and the rest of [MASK] 's regiment .
general [MASK] , who landed at [MASK] point on the 31 august express run , was placed in command of all the japanese troops on [MASK] .
on the night of 4 / 5 september , as three of the express destroyers — [MASK] , [MASK] , and [MASK] — prepared to shell henderson field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two u.s. ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " [MASK] " by the u.s. marines ) uss little and gregory that were used to [MASK] allied troops around the [MASK] / [MASK] area .

[MASK] 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while [MASK] 's second [MASK] — renamed the [MASK] battalion — would attack from the east .
the main attack would be by [MASK] 's " center body " , numbering 3 , 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the [MASK] perimeter .
by 7 september , most of [MASK] 's troops had started marching from [MASK] towards [MASK] point along the coastline .
about 250 japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base at [MASK] .
meanwhile , native island scouts — directed by british government official and officer in the british solomon islands [MASK] defence force , martin [MASK] — told the marines of japanese troops at [MASK] , near the village of [MASK] , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of [MASK] .
[MASK] launched a raid against the japanese troops at [MASK] .
destroyer transports uss mckean and [MASK] and two patrol boats took [MASK] of [MASK] 's men to [MASK] in two trips .

at 11 : 00 , the rest of [MASK] 's men landed .
with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft , [MASK] 's force pushed into the village .
the japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an allied supply ship convoy heading towards [MASK] point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead .
two marines were killed .
in [MASK] , [MASK] 's troops discovered the supply base for [MASK] 's forces , including large [MASK] of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a [MASK] radio .
the marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the [MASK] perimeter at 17 : 30 .
the quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 , 000 japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack .
[MASK] and colonel gerald thomas , [MASK] 's operations officer , believed that the japanese attack would come at the [MASK] ridge , a narrow , grassy , 1 , 000 m ( 1 , 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ s 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ e ) parallel to the [MASK] river just south of henderson field .
the ridge offered a natural [MASK] of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended .
[MASK] and thomas tried to persuade [MASK] to move forces to defend the ridge , but [MASK] refused , believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast .
finally , thomas convinced [MASK] that the ridge was a good location for [MASK] 's raiders to " rest " from their actions of the preceding month .
on 11 september , the 840 men of [MASK] 's unit — including the 1st raiders and the [MASK] — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it .
[MASK] 's center body of troops was planning to attack the [MASK] perimeter at the ridge , which they called " the [MASK] " ( [MASK] [MASK] ) because of its shape .
on 9 september , [MASK] 's troops left the coast at [MASK] point .
[MASK] into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their [MASK] attack points south and southeast of the airfield .
[MASK] of good maps , at least one faulty [MASK] , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and [MASK] , costing a lot of time .
at the same time , [MASK] 's troops approached the [MASK] perimeter from the west .
[MASK] had some intelligence on the marine defenses , extracted from a u.s. army pilot captured on 30 august .
during the day of 12 september , [MASK] 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night 's attacks .

at the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) .
six hundred yards north was hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge .
the [MASK] [MASK] was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high .
[MASK] placed the five companies from the [MASK] battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from hill 80 back to hill 123 .
two of the five [MASK] companies , " b " and " c " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy [MASK] , and the [MASK] river .

at 21 : 30 on 12 september , the japanese cruiser [MASK] and three destroyers shelled the [MASK] perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a [MASK] .
japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines , but did little damage .
at the same time , scattered groups of [MASK] 's troops began [MASK] with marines around the ridge .
[MASK] 's 1st battalion — led by major [MASK] [MASK] — attacked the [MASK] 's " c " company between the [MASK] and the [MASK] river , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge .
[MASK] 's unit became entangled with troops from [MASK] 's 3rd battalion under lieutenant colonel [MASK] [MASK] , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack on the ridge that night .
[MASK] , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the u.s. marine lines as well as coordinating his troops ' attacks , later complained , " due to the [MASK] jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control .

twelve u.s. marines were killed ; japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater .
although both [MASK] in the west and the [MASK] unit in the east tried to attack the marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines at dawn .
at first light on 13 september , [MASK] air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle .
the japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from [MASK] 's battalion .

they were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each marine .
[MASK] ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd battalion , 5th marine regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of [MASK] 's troops .
in addition , a battery of four [MASK] howitzers from the 11th marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with [MASK] 's front line units .

meanwhile , [MASK] 's 2nd battalion , under major [MASK] tamura , assembled for their planned assault against hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge .
marine observers spotted tamura 's preparations and called in artillery fire .
at about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 .
 1 in ) guns hit tamura 's position .
in response , two companies of tamura 's troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades .
tamura 's attack hit company b of the marine parachute battalion and also [MASK] company b , pushing the [MASK] off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the [MASK] .
to protect the exposed [MASK] company b , [MASK] immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill 123 .
at the same time , a japanese company from [MASK] 's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and parachute company c. [MASK] that their positions were now [MASK] , parachute companies b and c climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind hill 123 .
in the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized .
a few marines began [MASK] that the japanese were attacking with poison gas , [MASK] other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks .
after arriving behind hill 123 , some of the marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within [MASK] .
other marines began to follow them .
just at the moment that it appeared that the marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a [MASK] , [MASK] , major kenneth d. bailey from [MASK] 's staff , and other marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , [MASK] the marines back into defensive positions around hill 123 .
as the marines formed into a [MASK] - shaped line around hill 123 , tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge .
under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one japanese [MASK] , the marines repulsed the first two attacks by tamura 's men .
tamura 's troops [MASK] a 75 mm ( 2 .

with fixed bayonets , the [MASK] swept forward , killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill .
marines from other units , as well as members of [MASK] 's command staff , including major bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill 123 , who were running critically low .
said marine participant captain william j.
[MASK] , " the japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that [MASK] for a moment and then [MASK] the harder ...
when one wave was [MASK] down - and i mean [MASK] down - another followed it into death . "
the japanese hit [MASK] 's left flank just after the [MASK] took position but were again stopped by marine rifle , machine - gun , mortar , and grenade fire .
marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking japanese .
a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was " annihilated " by the marine artillery fire , which only 10 % of his company survived .

a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped one japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat .
the other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield .
when no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after [MASK] .
most of the rest of [MASK] 's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night .
as the sun rose on 14 september , pockets of japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge .
but with tamura 's battalion shattered after losing [MASK] of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , [MASK] 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended .

 7 km ) march over difficult terrain .
[MASK] 's troops began the march on the morning of 16 september .
almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded .
as the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to [MASK] their heavy equipment and then their rifles .
by the time most of them reached [MASK] 's positions at [MASK] five days later , only half still carried their weapons .
the [MASK] battalion 's survivors , attempting to follow [MASK] 's center body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and almost [MASK] to death before finally reaching [MASK] 's camp .

on 18 september , an allied naval convoy delivered 4 , 157 men from the 3rd provisional marine brigade ( the u.s. 7th marine regiment augmented by additional support units ) to [MASK] .
these reinforcements allowed [MASK] — beginning on 19 september — to establish an unbroken line of defense around the [MASK] perimeter .

the portion of current route 50 between [MASK] and petersburg received funding to become a spur of the ocean highway in 1910 .
the modern - day alignment of route 50 was legislated as part of pre - 1927 route 14 in 1917 , a route that was to run from cape may to [MASK] harbor city .
in the 1927 new jersey state highway renumbering , the portion of pre - 1927 route 14 between [MASK] and [MASK] harbor city was designated as route 50 , the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering .
route 50 retained its current routing in the 1953 new jersey state highway renumbering .
a freeway was proposed for route 50 around 1960 , running from the garden state parkway in dennis township north to us 30 in [MASK] township .
this proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the jersey shore resorts of cape may county for travelers from the delaware valley .
however , this freeway was canceled by the mid - 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along route 50 .
on november 21 , 2008 , construction began on making the interchange with the atlantic city expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the atlantic city expressway .
this project was completed on june 18 , 2010 .

= air rhodesia flight [MASK] =
air rhodesia flight [MASK] was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people 's revolutionary army ( [MASK] ) on 3 september 1978 , during the rhodesian bush war .
the aircraft involved , a vickers viscount named the [MASK] , was flying the last leg of air rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury , via the resort town of [MASK] .
soon after flight [MASK] took off , a group of [MASK] guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a soviet - made [MASK] 2 surface - to - air infrared [MASK] missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing .
an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of [MASK] was [MASK] by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up .
of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire .
three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived .
[MASK] leader joshua [MASK] publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the [MASK] in an interview with the bbc 's today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground .

the majority of [MASK] , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism .
a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming [MASK] [MASK] and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black [MASK] supported attacks of this kind .
reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the rhodesian government 's [MASK] .
[MASK] between [MASK] and prime minister ian smith , which had been progressing [MASK] , were immediately suspended by the furious [MASK] , with smith calling [MASK] a " monster " .
on 10 september , smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas .
the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months , attacking both [MASK] and its rival , the zimbabwe african national liberation army ( zanla ) .
the attack on [MASK] in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions .
five months later , in february 1979 , [MASK] shot down air rhodesia flight [MASK] , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident .
= = background = =
a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self - governing colony of rhodesia ( or southern rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by prime minister ian smith , to [MASK] declare independence from the united kingdom on 11 november 1965 .
the idea of " no independence before majority rule " had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went [MASK] internationally .
britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia .
two rival communist - backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the chinese - aligned zimbabwe african national union ( [MASK] ) , mostly comprising [MASK] , created the zimbabwe african national liberation army ( zanla ) and adopted aspects of [MASK] doctrine , while the [MASK] - dominated zimbabwe african people 's union ( [MASK] ) , aligned with soviet - style [MASK] – [MASK] and the warsaw pact , mobilised the zimbabwe people 's revolutionary army ( [MASK] ) .
these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the " second [MASK] " against the rhodesian government and security forces .
the resulting conflict , the rhodesian bush war , began in earnest in december 1972 , when zanla attacked [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] in north - eastern rhodesia .
after the security forces mounted a successful counter - insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour .
the leftist carnation revolution of april 1974 caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith 's administration , and led to mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with [MASK] .
around the same time , rhodesia 's other main [MASK] , south africa , adopted a [MASK] initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup .
following the abortive victoria falls conference of august 1975 , smith and the [MASK] leader joshua [MASK] held unsuccessful talks between december 1975 and march 1976 .
[MASK] and [MASK] announced in october 1976 , during the run - up to the unsuccessful geneva conference in december , that they would [MASK] attend conferences as a joint " patriotic front " .
in march 1978 , smith and non - militant nationalist groups headed by bishop [MASK] [MASK] , the reverend [MASK] [MASK] and chief jeremiah [MASK] agreed what became the " internal settlement " .
this created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in june 1979 , pursuant to [MASK] elections .
[MASK] and [MASK] were invited to participate , but refused ; [MASK] [MASK] dubbed smith 's black colleagues " the blacksmiths " .
[MASK] proclaimed 1978 to be " the year of the people " as the war continued .
officials from [MASK] 's united african national council , sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks , were killed by marxist – [MASK] guerrillas .
[MASK] also began to target christian missionaries , [MASK] in the killing of nine british missionaries and four children at [MASK] mission near the mozambican border on 23 june .
the transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the internal settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control .
no country recognised rhodesia 's interim administration .
smith again worked to bring [MASK] into the government , hoping this would lend it some [MASK] domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat zanla .
starting on 14 august 1978 , he attended secret meetings with [MASK] in [MASK] , zambia ( where [MASK] was based ) , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation [MASK] .

according to the south african military historian [MASK] [MASK] , negotiations between smith and [MASK] progressed well and " seemed on the verge of success " by the start of september 1978 .
on 2 september , smith and [MASK] revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .

rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 , in the latter stages of the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target .
the weapon that made such attacks feasible for [MASK] was the [MASK] 2 shoulder - launched surface - to - air missile launcher , supplied by the soviet union from the mid - 1970s as part of the warsaw pact 's materiel support .
by september 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful .
some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely .
no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the bush war .

air rhodesia was the country 's national airline , established by the government on 1 september 1967 to succeed central african airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year .
based at salisbury airport , air rhodesia 's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the south african cities of johannesburg and durban .
the flight [MASK] aircraft was a vickers viscount [MASK] , a british - made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing .
it was named the [MASK] after the river of the same name , which flowed between lake [MASK] and the rhodesian capital salisbury .
the [MASK] was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of [MASK] .
despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on [MASK] by [MASK] guerrillas on the northern side of the [MASK] ( in zambia ) , the resort had endured as one of rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations .
the flight on 3 september 1978 , sunday afternoon , from [MASK] to salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers , most of whom were [MASK] from salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake .

[MASK] 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north - east of central [MASK] , was the formerly white - owned [MASK] farm , which had been transformed into [MASK] 's main headquarters and training base under the name " freedom camp " .
[MASK] presumed that rhodesia would never [MASK] to attack a site so close to [MASK] .
about 4 , 000 guerrillas underwent training at freedom camp , with senior [MASK] staff also on site .
the rhodesian operation 's other targets were [MASK] , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of [MASK] , and [MASK] camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across zambia .
[MASK] targets deep inside zambia was a first for the rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked .
[MASK] by squadron leader chris dixon , who identified himself to [MASK] airport tower as " green leader " , a rhodesian air force group flew into zambia at very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding [MASK] radar ) and took control of the country 's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on [MASK] farm , informing [MASK] tower that the attack was against " rhodesian dissidents , and not against zambia " , and that rhodesian hawker hunters were [MASK] the [MASK] airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off .

using [MASK] airstrip in eastern zambia as a forward base , the rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three - day operation , and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1 , 500 [MASK] personnel , as well as some cuban instructors .
historians paul [MASK] and peter [MASK] write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of [MASK] 's army , then numbering about 10 , 000 fighters , had not been touched .
on the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the rhodesian raid .
[MASK] and [MASK] comment that for the rhodesian airmen , it would have been " impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young [MASK] recruits . "
[MASK] describes freedom camp as " a refugee camp for boys " , and says " [MASK] boys and girls " were killed .

the rhodesian attacks on zanla and [MASK] bases did much to restore white morale following the viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns .
[MASK] and the [MASK] president kenneth [MASK] all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the soviets and the british respectively .
martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered three - quarters of the country by the end of 1978 .
air rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti - [MASK] shielding for its [MASK] .
before this work was completed , [MASK] shot down a second viscount , air rhodesia flight [MASK] , on 12 february 1979 .
this time there were no survivors .
following the second [MASK] , air rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the [MASK] would be coated with low - radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently [MASK] .
according to tests conducted by the air force , a viscount so treated could not be detected by the [MASK] 's targeting system once it was over 2 , 000 feet ( 610 m ) .
there were no further viscount [MASK] in rhodesia .
in the elections held the following year under the internal settlement terms , boycotted by [MASK] and [MASK] , [MASK] won a majority , and became the first prime minister of the reconstituted , majority - ruled state of zimbabwe rhodesia on 1 june 1979 .
this new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and in december 1979 the lancaster house agreement was agreed in london by zimbabwe rhodesia , the uk government and the patriotic front , returning the country to its former colonial status .
the uk government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period .
fresh elections were won by [MASK] , who took power in april 1980 , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as zimbabwe .

in modern zimbabwe , it is not the viscount [MASK] but rather the [MASK] rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory .
state media in zimbabwe , prominently the herald newspaper , often claim that rhodesian forces [MASK] and deliberately [MASK] thousands of helpless refugees during such operations .
[MASK] 's [MASK] of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board .
the massacre of surviving flight [MASK] passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than [MASK] ; in his 1984 memoirs [MASK] repeated his claim that [MASK] fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that " i truly have no idea how the ten died " .

a monument to those killed in the rhodesian attack on [MASK] was built in zambia in 1998 , and dedicated jointly by the [MASK] and [MASK] governments .
a memorial to the victims of the two rhodesian viscount incidents , dubbed the viscount memorial , was erected on the grounds of the [MASK] monument in [MASK] , south africa in 2012 , and inaugurated on 1 september that year .
the names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft .

a british parliamentary motion put forward by labour mp kate [MASK] in february 2013 to [MASK] [MASK] the viscount attacks and [MASK] the victims on the anniversary of the second [MASK] prompted [MASK] in the [MASK] press , with the herald branding it a racist " [MASK] motion " intended to [MASK] the [MASK] administration and its supporters .
[MASK] [MASK] , a former [MASK] commander , described the move as a [MASK] motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at lancaster house .
christopher [MASK] , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling [MASK] 's proposed commemoration " a [MASK] ... [ that ] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle .
there is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country . "
[MASK] 's official response to [MASK] 's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts " civilians get caught up in cross - fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors " , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the viscount [MASK] with those killed at [MASK] .

[MASK] ( / [MASK] / ) ( [MASK] ’ al in modern [MASK] [MASK] ) is the ruins of an ancient city found in a [MASK] in guatemala .
[MASK] [MASK] , a gum - [MASK] , reported the ruins to la [MASK] , a [MASK] newspaper , which named the site [MASK] .
after the berlin academy of sciences ' magazine republished the report in 1853 , [MASK] and treasure hunters began visiting the forest .
today tourism to the site may help protect the [MASK] .
it is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre - columbian maya civilization .
it is located in the archaeological region of the [MASK] basin in what is now northern guatemala .
situated in the department of el [MASK] , the site is part of guatemala 's [MASK] national park and in 1979 it was declared a unesco world heritage site .
[MASK] was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient maya .
though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century bc , [MASK] reached its [MASK] during the classic period , c .
200 to 900 ad .
during this time , the city dominated much of the maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout [MASK] such as the great metropolis of [MASK] in the distant valley of mexico .
there is evidence that [MASK] was conquered by [MASK] in the 4th century ad .
following the end of the late classic period , no new major monuments were built at [MASK] and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned .
these events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century .
[MASK] is the best understood of any of the large lowland maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces .
= = etymology = =
the name [MASK] may be derived from [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] in the [MASK] maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning " at the [MASK] " .
the name was apparently applied to one of the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region .
it has alternatively been interpreted as meaning " the place of the voices " in the [MASK] maya language .
[MASK] , however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s .
[MASK] inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as [MASK] [MASK] or [MASK] [MASK] , meaning " first [MASK] " .
[MASK] may have come to have been called this because [MASK] [MASK] also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name .
the kingdom as a whole was simply called [MASK] , which is the reading of the " hair bundle " emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo .
its precise meaning remains obscure .
= = location = =
the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa [MASK] , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) by road to the southwest .
[MASK] is approximately [MASK] kilometres ( 188 mi ) north of guatemala city .
it is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the contemporary maya city of [MASK] and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of [MASK] .
the city was located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast of its great classic period rival , [MASK] , and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) northwest of [MASK] 's ally [MASK] , now in belize .
the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 .
 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 , 000 structures .
the topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands .
the major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised [MASK] spanning the swamps .
the area around [MASK] has been declared as the [MASK] national park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) .
the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern guatemala that formed the [MASK] of lowland maya civilization .
the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east – west trade route across the [MASK] peninsula .
[MASK] trees at the [MASK] park include gigantic [MASK] ( [MASK] [MASK] ) the sacred tree of the maya ; tropical cedar ( [MASK] [MASK] ) , and honduras mahogany ( [MASK] [MASK] ) .
regarding the fauna , [MASK] , white - [MASK] [MASK] , gray foxes , [MASK] 's spider monkeys , [MASK] monkeys , [MASK] eagles , falcons , [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] , green parrots and [MASK] ants can be seen there regularly .
[MASK] , [MASK] , and cougars are also said to [MASK] in the park .
for centuries this city was completely covered under jungle .
the average annual rainfall at [MASK] is 1 , [MASK] millimetres ( 76 .
 6 in ) .
one of the largest of the classic maya cities , [MASK] had no water other than what was collected from [MASK] and stored in ten reservoirs .
archaeologists working in [MASK] during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use .
the [MASK] national park covers an area of 575 .
 83 square kilometres ( 222 .
 33 sq mi ) .
it was created on 26 may 1955 under the auspices of the [MASK] de [MASK] e historia and was the first protected area in guatemala .
= = population = =
population estimates for [MASK] vary from 10 , 000 to as high as 90 , 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range .
the population of [MASK] began a continuous curve of growth starting in the [MASK] period ( approximately 2000 bc – ad 200 ) , with a peak in the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline .
for the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the [MASK] defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at [MASK] per square kilometer ( [MASK] per square mile ) .
in an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 .
 5 mi ) radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at 120 , 000 ; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer ( [MASK] per square mile ) .
in a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at 425 , 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) .
these population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive [MASK] that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture .
however , some archaeologists , such as david webster , believe these figures to be far too high .

a [MASK] of [MASK] ceramics dating from about 700 - 400 bc were found in a sealed [MASK] , a subterranean bottle - shaped chamber .
major construction at [MASK] was already taking place in the late [MASK] period , first appearing around 400 – 300 bc , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still [MASK] by sites further north such as el [MASK] and [MASK] .
at this time , [MASK] participated in the widespread [MASK] culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire [MASK] peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all of belize .
two temples dating to late [MASK] times had masonry - walled [MASK] that may have been [MASK] - vaulted , although this has not been proven .
one of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a [MASK] background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red .
in the 1st century ad rich burials first appeared and [MASK] underwent a political and cultural [MASK] as its giant northern neighbors declined .
at the end of the late [MASK] , the [MASK] style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence [MASK] , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the [MASK] and early murals at the city .

[MASK] rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted at [MASK] .
according to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by [MASK] - [MASK] - [MASK] , perhaps in the 3rd century ad .
at the beginning of the early classic , power in the maya region was concentrated at [MASK] and [MASK] , in the core of the maya [MASK] .

the site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of [MASK] and conflict with other maya states , including [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] .
the site was defeated at the end of the early classic by [MASK] , which rose to take [MASK] 's place as the paramount center in the southern maya lowlands .
the earlier part of the early classic saw hostilities between [MASK] and its neighbor [MASK] , with [MASK] recording the capture of prisoners from [MASK] .

these recorded events strongly suggest that [MASK] k ’ [MASK] ’ led a [MASK] invasion that defeated the native [MASK] king , who was captured and immediately executed .

the site became an outpost of [MASK] , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the caribbean .
although the new rulers of [MASK] were foreign , their descendants were rapidly [MASK] .
[MASK] became the key ally and trading partner of [MASK] in the maya lowlands .
after being conquered by [MASK] , [MASK] rapidly dominated the northern and eastern [MASK] .
[MASK] , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into [MASK] 's kingdom .
other sites , such as [MASK] and [MASK] de san josé near lake [MASK] [MASK] became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north .
by the middle of the 5th century [MASK] had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction .
around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of [MASK] 's hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of [MASK] lying to the east and west of the city .
additional fortifications were probably also built to the south .
these defenses protected [MASK] 's core population and agricultural resources , [MASK] an area of approximately 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) .
recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose .

the founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose [MASK] 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the maya region .
the interaction between these sites and [MASK] was intense over the next three centuries .
a long - running rivalry between [MASK] and [MASK] began in the 6th century , with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile [MASK] [MASK] against each other in what has been likened to a long - running war between two maya [MASK] .
the kings of these two capitals adopted the title [MASK] ' , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to " high king " .

in the latter half of the 6th century ad , a serious crisis [MASK] the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture .
this hiatus in activity at [MASK] was long unexplained until later [MASK] [MASK] identified that the period was prompted by [MASK] 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of [MASK] and the [MASK] polity in ad 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of [MASK] .
the badly eroded altar 21 at [MASK] described how [MASK] suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in april 562 .
it seems that [MASK] was an ally of [MASK] in the wider conflict between that city and [MASK] , with the defeat of [MASK] having a lasting impact upon the city .
[MASK] was not sacked but its power and influence were broken .
after its great victory , [MASK] grew rapidly and some of [MASK] 's population may have been forcibly relocated there .

it appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of [MASK] to bring about the collapse of [MASK] 's southern allies .
this upset the balance of power in the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of [MASK] .
in the 8th century , the rulers of [MASK] collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the north acropolis .
by the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at [MASK] slowed .
[MASK] architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers .

by the 9th century , the crisis of the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations [MASK] and city after city falling into silence .
increasingly endemic warfare in the maya region caused [MASK] 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline .
construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of temple 3 , the last of the city 's major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th k [MASK] in [MASK] .
the beginning of the 10th [MASK] [MASK] in 830 passed [MASK] , and marks the beginning of a 60 - year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city .
during this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under [MASK] 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the [MASK] emblem glyph , with [MASK] apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence .
in [MASK] , [MASK] k 'awiil is mentioned on a stela at [MASK] as visiting that city as the divine lord of [MASK] but he is not recorded elsewhere and [MASK] 's once great power was little more than a memory .
in [MASK] , [MASK] k 'awiil is mentioned on a stela at [MASK] as visiting that city as the divine lord of [MASK] but she is not recorded elsewhere and [MASK] 's once great power was little more than a memory .
the sites of [MASK] and [MASK] had by now inherited the once exclusive [MASK] emblem glyph .
as [MASK] and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered [MASK] , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels .
[MASK] and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly .
there is not much evidence from [MASK] that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the maya region during the terminal classic , although an influx of refugees from the [MASK] region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources .
in the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of [MASK] , as evidenced by a stela erected in the great plaza by [MASK] chan k 'awiil ii in [MASK] .
this was the last monument erected at [MASK] before the city finally fell into silence .
the former satellites of [MASK] , such as [MASK] and [MASK] , did not last much longer , [MASK] their final monuments in [MASK] .
by the end of the 9th century the vast majority of [MASK] 's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple [MASK] dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial [MASK] .
the squatters blocked some [MASK] in the rooms they [MASK] in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non - [MASK] items such as musical instruments .
these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them .
some monuments were [MASK] and some were moved to new locations .
before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the north acropolis being explored for [MASK] and the easier to find tombs being looted .
after 950 , [MASK] was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in [MASK] [MASK] interspersed among the ruins .
even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the [MASK] claimed the ruins for the next thousand years .
some of [MASK] 's population may have migrated to the [MASK] lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a [MASK] in population levels in the first half of the 9th century .
the most likely cause of collapse at [MASK] is [MASK] and agrarian failure .
the fall of [MASK] was a blow to the heart of classic maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty .
however , new research regarding [MASK] [MASK] from the [MASK] reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of [MASK] .

as is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region .
it seems that local people never [MASK] about [MASK] and they guided [MASK] expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s .
some second- or third - hand accounts of [MASK] appeared in print starting in the 17th century , continuing through the writings of john lloyd stephens in the early 19th century ( stephens and his illustrator frederick [MASK] heard rumors of a lost city , with white building tops towering above the jungle , during their 1839 - 40 travels in the region ) .

because of the site 's [MASK] from modern towns , however , no explorers visited [MASK] until [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] , respectively the commissioner and the governor of [MASK] , visited it in 1848 .
artist [MASK] [MASK] accompanied them and their account was published in germany in 1853 .
several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph [MASK] in the 19th century ( including alfred p. [MASK] in 1881 - 82 ) and the early 20th century .
[MASK] archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s .
in 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule .
in 1956 the [MASK] project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the maya area .
from 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the university of pennsylvania [MASK] project .
they mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures .
excavations directed by edwin m. [MASK] and later by william coe of the university investigated the north acropolis and the central plaza from 1957 to 1969 .
the [MASK] project recorded over 200 monuments at the site .
in 1979 , the [MASK] government began a further archeological project at [MASK] , which continued through to 1984 .
[MASK] george lucas used [MASK] as a filming location for the first star wars film , episode iv : a new hope , released in 1977 .
temple i at [MASK] was featured on the reverse of the 50 [MASK] [MASK] .
[MASK] is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park .
a site museum has been built at [MASK] ; it was completed in 1964 .

[MASK] has been partially restored by the university of pennsylvania and the government of guatemala .
it was one of the largest of the classic period maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the americas .
the architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( 230 ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments .
there is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors .
there are also seven courts for playing the [MASK] [MASK] , including a set of 3 in the seven temples plaza , a unique feature in [MASK] .
the limestone used for construction was local and [MASK] on - site .
the depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to [MASK] them and were used as reservoirs , together with some [MASK] natural depressions .
the main [MASK] were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that [MASK] rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs .
the residential area of [MASK] covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated .
a huge set of earthworks discovered by dennis e. [MASK] and donald [MASK] in the 1960s rings [MASK] with a 6 - metre ( 20 ft ) wide trench behind a rampart .
the 16 square kilometres ( 6 .
 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) ( see below ) .
population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 , 000 and 90 , 000 , and possibly 425 , 000 in the surrounding area .
recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is [MASK] as a defensive feature .
in addition , some parts of the [MASK] were integrated into a canal system .
the [MASK] of [MASK] varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and [MASK] than originally thought .
= = = [MASK] = = =
by the late classic , a network of [MASK] ( [MASK] ) linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core .
these linked the great plaza with temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 , 460 ft ) to the west ) and the temple of the [MASK] ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 .
 62 mi ) to the southeast ) .
these broad [MASK] were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the maler , [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] .
they assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams .
the maler causeway runs north from behind temple i to group h. a large bas - relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of group h. it depicts two bound captives and dates to the late classic .

the great plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple - pyramids .
on the north side it is bordered by the north acropolis and on the south by the central acropolis .
the central acropolis is a palace complex just south of the great plaza .
the north acropolis , together with the great plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the maya area ; the [MASK] project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history .
it is a complex group with construction beginning in the [MASK] period , around 350 bc .
it developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the classic period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures .
after ad 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier northern platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gradually hiding it from view .
eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century ad , each of them had an elaborate [MASK] and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods .
by the 9th century ad , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the north acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits .
the north acropolis continued to receive burials into the [MASK] period .
the south acropolis is found next to temple v. it was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than 20 , 000 square metres ( 220 , 000 sq ft ) .
the plaza of the seven temples is to the west of the south acropolis .
it is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side .
the mundo [MASK] is to the west of the plaza of the seven temples .
it is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the [MASK] period at [MASK] .
the complex was organized as a large e - group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples .
the mundo [MASK] complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history .
by ad 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of [MASK] in the valley of mexico , including the use of the [MASK] - [MASK] form .
during the early classic period ( c .
250 – 600 ) the mundo [MASK] became one of the twin [MASK] of the city , the other being the north acropolis .
from ad 250 to [MASK] it may have served as the royal necropolis .
the mundo [MASK] complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the university of pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the lost world pyramid and a small platform to the west of it .
group g lies just south of the [MASK] causeway .
the complex dates to the late classic and consists of palace - type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at [MASK] .
it has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of 29 vaulted chambers .
the remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey .
one of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask .
group h is centered on a large plaza to the north of the great plaza .
it is bordered by temples dating to the late classic .
there are nine twin - pyramid [MASK] at [MASK] , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed .
they vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis .
these pyramids are flat - topped and have [MASK] on all four sides .
a row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly [MASK] from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair .
on the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine [MASK] .
the entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 - year ( or k [MASK] ) intervals during the late classic .
the first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the east plaza .
it was once thought that these complexes were unique to [MASK] but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as [MASK] and [MASK] , and they may reflect the extent of [MASK] 's political dominance in the late classic .
group q is a twin - pyramid complex , and is one of the largest at [MASK] .
it was built by [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] ii in [MASK] in order to mark the end of the 17th k [MASK] .
most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re - erected .
group r is another twin - pyramid complex , dated to 790 .
it is close to the maler causeway .

there are thousands of ancient structures at [MASK] and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work .
the most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled temples i - vi , each of which support a temple structure on their [MASK] .
some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high .
they were numbered [MASK] during the early survey of the site .
it is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years .
temple i ( also known as the temple of [MASK] [MASK] or temple of the great jaguar ) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to [MASK] chan k [MASK] , who was [MASK] in the structure in ad [MASK] , the pyramid was completed around 740 – 750 .
the temple rises 47 metres ( 154 ft ) high .
the massive [MASK] that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives .
the tomb of the king was discovered by aubrey [MASK] of the university of pennsylvania in 1962 .
among items recovered from the late classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people , finely carved and rubbed with [MASK] , as well as [MASK] and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink .
the shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the [MASK] spanned by wooden [MASK] fashioned from multiple beams .
the outermost [MASK] is plain but the two inner [MASK] were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in europe .
temple ii ( also known as the temple of the mask ) it was built around ad 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high .
like other major temples at [MASK] , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the [MASK] spanned by wooden [MASK] , only the middle of which was carved .
the temple was dedicated to the wife of [MASK] chan k [MASK] , although no tomb was found .
the queen 's portrait was carved into the [MASK] spanning the doorway of the summit shrine .
one of the beams from this [MASK] is now in the american museum of natural history in new york .
temple iii ( also known as the temple of the jaguar priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at [MASK] .
it stood 55 metres ( 180 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof [MASK] , possibly showing dark sun engaged in a ritual dance around ad [MASK] .
the temple shrine possesses two chambers .
temple iv is the tallest temple - pyramid at [MASK] , measuring 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb .
temple iv marks the reign of [MASK] ’ in chan [MASK] ( ruler b , the son of ruler a or [MASK] chan k 'awiil i ) and two carved wooden [MASK] over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 .

temple iv is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the maya region in the 8th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre - columbian structure in the americas although the pyramid of the sun at [MASK] may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at el [MASK] .
temple v stands south of the central acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler .
the temple stands 57 metres ( 187 ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure at [MASK] - only temple iv is taller .
the temple has been dated to about ad 700 , in the late classic period , via [MASK] analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] in the second half of the 7th century .
temple vi is also known as the temple of the [MASK] and was dedicated in ad [MASK] .
it is notable for its 12 - metre ( 39 ft ) high roof - comb .
[MASK] of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof - comb .
the temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is [MASK] .
temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of [MASK] chan k 'awiil i ( known as [MASK] 48 ) in the north acropolis .
it started life in the early classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway .
later in the early classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels .
during the hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( [MASK] 23 ) .
while the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( [MASK] 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building .
the pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall .
the final version of temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction .
structure 34 is a pyramid in the north acropolis that was built by [MASK] chan k 'awiil ii over the tomb of his father , [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] i.
structure 34 is a pyramid in the north acropolis that was built by [MASK] chan k 'awiil ii over the tomb of her father , [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] i.
the pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine , the rooms situated one behind the other .
structure [MASK] - 43 is an unusual radial temple in the east plaza , built over a pre - existing twin pyramid complex .
it is built into the end of the east plaza ballcourt and possessed four entry [MASK] and three [MASK] , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the central acropolis for a stairway on that side .
the building has a [MASK] - [MASK] platform profile , modified from the original style found at [MASK] .
in fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer [MASK] with el [MASK] and [MASK] than with [MASK] itself .
the vertical [MASK] panels are set between sloping [MASK] panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols .
large flower symbols are set into the sloping [MASK] panels , related to the venus and star symbols used at [MASK] .
the roof of the structure was decorated with [MASK] although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth .
the second head possesses a [MASK] tongue but is probably not that of a snake .
the temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of [MASK] [MASK] chaak or that of his son [MASK] chan k 'awiil i , in the later part of the 7th century .

it is located near to the lost world pyramid .
structure [MASK] - 53 is a small [MASK] - style platform that dates to about ad 600 .
it had [MASK] on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure .
the lost world pyramid ( structure [MASK] - 54 ) is the largest structure in the mundo [MASK] complex .
it lies in the southwest portion of [MASK] ’ s central core , south of temple iii and west of temple v. it was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the late [MASK] ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un - impacted by later building activity at [MASK] .
by the end of the late [MASK] this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the maya region .
it attained its final form during the reign of [MASK] [MASK] ich 'aak in the 4th century ad , in the early classic , standing more than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) high with [MASK] on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from [MASK] materials .
although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex [MASK] to the layout that defines the so - called e - groups , identified as solar observatories .

= tropical storm [MASK] ( 2008 ) =
tropical storm [MASK] was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season .
[MASK] developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the african coast on august 31 .
the wave quickly became organized and was declared tropical depression ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south - southeast of the cape verde islands on september 2 .
the depression was quickly upgraded to tropical storm [MASK] around noon the same day .
over the next several days , [MASK] moved in a general west - northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on september 3 .
strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of hurricane ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken .
on september 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused [MASK] to weaken into a tropical depression .
[MASK] deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm .
the low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of [MASK] on september 10 .
however , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of st. croix .
= = meteorological history = =
tropical storm [MASK] formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of africa near the end of august 2008 .
it tracked south of cape verde and slowly developed , and on september 2 the disturbance became tropical depression ten while located south - southeast of the cape verde islands .
as the depression became more organized , an eye - like feature developed in the upper levels of the system .
the depression was upgraded to tropical storm [MASK] six hours after forming .
[MASK] was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly .
[MASK] continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical .
however , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the national hurricane center was uncertain of its actual intensity .
despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification .
the storm was also heading into an area where shear was [MASK] to significantly increase due to an upper - level trough diving southward .
despite convection being partially removed from the center of [MASK] , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on september 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized .
the intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger .
[MASK] reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( [MASK] ) as it continued to become more organized .
however , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken .
[MASK] towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system .
during the afternoon hours , the structure of [MASK] began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll .
by the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center .
despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern [MASK] of [MASK] .
the center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity .
the forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as [MASK] continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 - day forecast was predicted .
however , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and [MASK] weakened again .
by the afternoon , the center of [MASK] was only a [MASK] of clouds , devoid of convection .
during the overnight hours on september 4 into the morning of september 5 , convection associated with [MASK] began to [MASK] somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong [MASK] wind shear .
by mid - morning , [MASK] re - intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection .
however , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on [MASK] by late morning .
the convection around the system became [MASK] from the center and [MASK] weakened slightly .
the weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong [MASK] shear .
[MASK] became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid - afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status .
[MASK] regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm .
due to the lack of convection , [MASK] was downgraded to a tropical depression at [MASK] ( [MASK] ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) .
since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm [MASK] over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression .
the next morning , [MASK] was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm .
no redevelopment was expected with [MASK] as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated .
however , the remnant low associated with [MASK] began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on september 7 .
[MASK] around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed .
on september 8 , wind shear took over the system again .
[MASK] around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more .
the national hurricane center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed .
finally , on september 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of [MASK] deteriorating into an open wave .
however , on september 10 , the remnants of [MASK] redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system .
once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of [MASK] headed towards the bahamas .
however , on september 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely .
= = impact = =
as [MASK] passed to the south of the cape verde islands on september 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around 0 .
 55 inches ( 14 mm ) .
there were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor .
several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from [MASK] brought showers and thunderstorms to st. croix where up to 1 in ( 25 .
 4 mm ) of rain fell .
the heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding .
no known damage was caused by the flood .

mount [MASK] is the highest summit of the rocky mountains of north america and the highest point in the u.s. state of colorado and the entire mississippi river drainage basin .
the ultra - prominent 14 , 440 - foot ( [MASK] .

mount [MASK] is located in san isabel national forest , 12 .
 1 miles ( 19 .
 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 ° ) of the city of [MASK] in lake county , colorado .
the mountain was named in honor of colorado statesman samuel [MASK] [MASK] , who was active in the formative period of the state and governor of the territory of colorado from 1873 to 1874 .
henry w. [MASK] of the [MASK] survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 .
the [MASK] and most popular climbing routes are categorized as class 1 to 2 or a + in [MASK] [MASK] .
mount [MASK] is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the rocky mountains .
= = geography = =
mount [MASK] is visible to the southwest of [MASK] , often snow - capped even in the summer .
many other [MASK] surround [MASK] in all directions , and it is very close to central colorado 's collegiate [MASK] .
the neighboring mount massive , to the north , is the second - highest peak in the rocky mountains and the third - highest in the contiguous united states , and la plata peak , to the south , is the fifth - highest in the rockies .
the community of twin lakes lies at the base of mount [MASK] , denver is about 130 miles ( [MASK] km ) to the east , [MASK] is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the north , and [MASK] is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west .
[MASK] , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town .
[MASK] 's parent peak is mount whitney in california .
including alaska and hawaii , mount [MASK] is the fourteenth - highest mountain in the united states .
weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the [MASK] ; [MASK] and snow are possible year - round .
an electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the july 1894 issue of science .
= = geology = =
mount [MASK] is part of the [MASK] range , an [MASK] of the laramide [MASK] which separated from the mosquito range to the east around 28 million years ago .
the tops of this range were heavily [MASK] , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues .
for example , the base of [MASK] on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and [MASK] rocks deposited when the glaciers [MASK] , which lie on a lateral [MASK] .
further up the eastern side there is a large [MASK] with a small [MASK] .
there are also lakes to both the north and south , [MASK] and twin lakes respectively ; the twin lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and [MASK] lake was created by the [MASK] sugar [MASK] dam .
mount [MASK] is composed largely of [MASK] .
however , the summit ridge consists of [MASK] basement rock , which is pre - [MASK] in origin and about 1 .
 7 billion years old .
there are various igneous [MASK] including [MASK] , as well as " bands " of [MASK] and [MASK] .
unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , [MASK] lacks both a permanent [MASK] and a prominent north - facing [MASK] , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation .

mount [MASK] was named by miners in honor of samuel [MASK] [MASK] , the governor of the then - territory of colorado , because he brokered a treaty in september 1873 with the [MASK] tribe that opened up more than 3 , 000 , 000 acres ( 12 , 000 km2 ) of reservation land to mining and railroad activity .

the first recorded ascent of the peak was by [MASK] [MASK] in 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part of the [MASK] survey .
originally measured as 14 , [MASK] feet ( 4 , [MASK] m ) in height , mount [MASK] 's elevation was later adjusted to 14 , 440 feet ( 4 , 400 m ) following a re - evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests .
the actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the north american [MASK] [MASK] of 1988 ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the sea level [MASK] of 1929 .
a matter of some contention arose after the great depression over the heights of [MASK] and its neighbor , mount massive , which differ in elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 .
 7 m ) .
this led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the mount massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the mount [MASK] proponents [MASK] them .
the effort was ultimately unsuccessful and mount [MASK] has remained the highest peak in colorado .
the first [MASK] ascent of [MASK] occurred in 1949 , when a jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development .
= = flora and fauna = =
the summit of mount [MASK] is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as [MASK] [MASK] ( sky - pilot ) , [MASK] [MASK] ( old - man - of - the - mountain ) , and [MASK] [MASK] ( alpine [MASK] ) .

there are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over 4 , 100 feet ( 1 , 200 m ) of elevation .

the 4 .
 6 miles ( 7 .
 4 km ) long north ( main ) [MASK] trail begins close to the [MASK] creek [MASK] , and gains about 4 , 500 feet ( 1 , 400 m ) .
the trail is open to [MASK] , mountain [MASK] and hunters during season .
an easier , but longer route , the south [MASK] trail , is 5 .
 5 miles ( 8 .
 9 km ) long , climbing 4 , 600 feet ( 1 , 400 m ) at a less - punishing gradient than the north [MASK] trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge .
the most difficult of the main routes is the black cloud trail , a class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace , gains 5 , 300 feet ( 1 , 600 m ) in elevation , and also involves an ascent of the sub - peak , south [MASK] , at 14 , 134 feet ( 4 , 308 m ) .
even healthy and experienced [MASK] report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places .
the elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 .
 5 - mile ascent .
there are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from south [MASK] creek [MASK] and echo canyon [MASK] respectively .
although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist [MASK] skills or technical rock climbing .
the main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness .
this can affect anyone , even those who are [MASK] .
in serious cases , it can lead to high - altitude pulmonary [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , [MASK] , and death .
[MASK] are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes .
although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , anna elizabeth dickinson , the [MASK] , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the u.s. government .
= scientology in germany =
the church of scientology has been present in germany since 1970 .
german authorities estimate that there are 4 , 000 active scientologists in germany today ; the church of scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 , 000 .
the church of scientology has encountered particular [MASK] from the german press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in germany .
german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or [MASK] community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions .
the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities .
the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion .
it views it as an abusive business [MASK] as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the german constitution .
this stance has been criticized , most notably by the u.s. government , which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect [MASK] .
scientologists in germany face specific political and economic restrictions .
they are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so - called " sect [MASK] " to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization .
german federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning scientology in late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds .
despite this , polls suggest that most germans favor banning scientology altogether .
= = background = =
scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the united states by l. ron hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement .
its stated [MASK] aim is to " clear the planet " , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations .
scientology teaches that the source of people 's [MASK] lies in " [MASK] " , psychological [MASK] acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of [MASK] called " [MASK] " made available by the church of scientology .
the fact that scientologists have to pay large fees for [MASK] and other scientology services has brought controversy to scientology throughout much of its history , with governments [MASK] it as a profit - making enterprise rather than as a religion .
critics maintain that scientology is " a business - driven , [MASK] [MASK] , totalitarian ideology with world - dominating aspirations " , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for scientology courses .
scientology has fought [MASK] lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion .
these efforts have been partly successful – scientology has gained recognition as a tax - exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in australia in 1983 and the united states in 1993 , and in 2007 won an important case at the european court of human rights , which [MASK] russia for failing to register scientology as a religion .
the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion , but a " commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism " whose " totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany 's democratic society " .
accordingly , the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization .
germany is not alone in opposing scientology ; in france , the church of scientology was convicted of organized fraud in october 2009 , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for scientology products , and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether .
scientology is similarly controversial in belgium , greece and the uk .
on the subject of scientology 's status as a religion , the german government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the federal labor court of germany .
that court , noting hubbard 's instruction that scientologists should " make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " scientology [MASK] to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " .
in the same decision , the court also found that scientology uses " [MASK] and totalitarian practices " .
given the lessons of germany 's 20th - century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power .
[MASK] in scientology writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " [MASK] " people who stand in the way of progress towards scientology 's [MASK] world " without [MASK] , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism , and have led to scientology being classified as an " [MASK] political movement " .
to further justify its stance , the german government has also pointed to the long history of u.s. court cases involving scientology , including the conviction of 11 top scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of u.s. government agencies , [MASK] and the theft of government documents , a 1994 u.s. supreme court finding that scientology practices took place in a " [MASK] environment " , and scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators .
in examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are " structured so as to make the individual [MASK] and financially dependent on a scientology system " , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family .

scientology first became active in germany in 1970 .
by 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " scientology churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " scientology [MASK] " ) in germany .
the german scientology churches are located in the big cities – munich , hamburg , berlin , düsseldorf , frankfurt am main , hanover and [MASK] .
of the scientology [MASK] , nine are in baden - [MASK] , and three in [MASK] .
following german re - unification , scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former german democratic republic ; most adherents are found in baden - [MASK] , [MASK] and north - rhine [MASK] .
scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or [MASK] in germany ; their umbrella organisation is the scientology [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] germany 's domestic intelligence service , the [MASK] für [MASK] ( [MASK] , or federal office for the protection of the constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 , 000 scientologists in germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 .
the church of scientology reported around 30 , 000 members from the mid - 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years .
however more recently scientology has said it has only 12 , 000 members .
[MASK] in scientology membership numbers arise because the church of scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement .
the number of [MASK] bound scientology staff members working in german scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred .
scientology formulated a " [MASK] germany " strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by scientology in other countries and regions of the world – with the long - term aim of transforming german society in line with the [MASK] ideal : a non - [MASK] society in which scientology enjoys [MASK] influence .
the programme sought to address scientology 's image problems in germany , to identify weak points in germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as germany 's national socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in german society , with a special emphasis on [MASK] scientologists into key positions in industry and government .
as most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in .
however , according to the [MASK] , the strategy has not had any significant success .
by 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise scientology .
according to [MASK] & [MASK] ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " [MASK] germany " programme is still being pursued .
= = = public opposition = = =
german public discourse does not regard scientology as a religion , but generally [MASK] it as a [MASK] ( cult or sect ) , or as an [MASK] profit - making venture preying on vulnerable minds .
public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about " youth religions " such as the [MASK] church , [MASK] , children of god , and the divine light mission .
the most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the " sect commissioners " ( [MASK] ) of germany 's protestant churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private " initiatives of parents and concerned persons " .
[MASK] [MASK] ( " educational information campaign " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the church of scientology over its [MASK] in public places , and published an influential book , the [MASK] of scientology and its front [MASK] .
in 1981 , the organization 's founder , [MASK] [MASK] , became the director of [MASK] für [MASK] und [MASK] [MASK] ( " campaign for [MASK] and [MASK] freedom " ) , germany 's most prominent anti - cult organization .
[MASK] from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious [MASK] , the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979 .
[MASK] by events such as the [MASK] siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides associated with the order of the solar temple , and the 1995 [MASK] [MASK] incidents in japan , german fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s , with scientology attracting particular attention .
[MASK] that scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when robert [MASK] young , an american ex - scientologist and former pr official in the church of scientology , visited german officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in der [MASK] , a widely - read weekly magazine , describing scientology as a totalitarian system operating a [MASK] – the [MASK] project force – for members of scientology 's sea org found guilty of [MASK] .
from the mid - 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience .
as noted by the religious scholar hubert [MASK] , scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will - less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state " .
this view of scientology as a public enemy , [MASK] adds , " became a matter of political [MASK] " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social [MASK] .
stephen a. kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of german government shared the insistence that scientology should be suppressed .
scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business - driven organization [ ... ] guilty of significant human rights abuses . "
officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was " [MASK] to a democratic state " .
federal [MASK] and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of scientology .
government publications on the dangers of [MASK] increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them dealt with the church of scientology .
the german courts had approved such publications in 1989 , seeing them as part of the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom .
in 1996 , the german parliament launched an [MASK] ( [MASK] ) commission to investigate [MASK] and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about scientology .
its final report , published in june 1998 , concluded that scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by germany 's domestic intelligence services .
an area of widespread concern in the german media has been the alleged " infiltration " of businesses by scientologists , in line with scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination .
attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium - size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management - training companies .
management - consultancy firms led by scientologists often conceal their association with scientology ; once they have recruited members of their clients ' upper management , these managers may send employees to scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used .
an expensive commercial version of scientology 's oxford [MASK] analysis , usually offered free as part of scientology [MASK] in public places , temporarily entered some major german companies ( who were unaware of its [MASK] ) via such a management - consultancy firm .
in the mid - 2000s , german sect experts expressed concerns that scientologists were becoming active in the german after - school [MASK] market .
these concerns arose because customers of around 20 after - school [MASK] centres operated by scientologists in frankfurt , hamburg , [MASK] and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by scientologists , using scientology methods .
[MASK] advertising the [MASK] services would at most mention the name of l. ron hubbard , the founder of scientology , but not scientology itself .
in early 2008 , thomas [MASK] , [MASK] commissioner of the german lutheran church in berlin and [MASK] , and the historian [MASK] knopp both likened the scientologist hollywood actor tom cruise to goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
[MASK] and knopp cited a leaked scientology video in which cruise was seen asking the audience whether scientologists should " clean up " the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which [MASK] and knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience 's response to goebbels ' famous question , " do you want total war ? "
[MASK] 's and knopp 's comments found few critics in germany .
most germans consider scientology a [MASK] organization .
in 1997 , time reported that 70 % of germans favoured banning scientology ; a poll conducted in september 2008 by der [MASK] found 67 % support for a ban .
german scholars such as [MASK] [MASK] and gerald [MASK] have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around scientology in germany : in their view , efforts to " frame " information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying [MASK] .
in [MASK] 's words , this includes both the " efforts of german politicians to enhance their popularity with strong - [MASK] statements " and " scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution " ; commenting on foreign reporting on scientology in germany , she adds that " the american press may prefer [MASK] news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to american stereotypes " .

both [MASK] and [MASK] assert that the situation is compounded by the general [MASK] of scientific studies of scientology .
[MASK] as well as irving [MASK] , professor of religious studies at the university of calgary in canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by german scholars .
[MASK] attributes this situation to the strong influence of the christian churches in germany , which has made german academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate .
in 2010 a german public broadcaster , [MASK] , showed the film until nothing remains , a [MASK] account of the effect scientology had on one german family .
said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8 .
 69 million .
= = legal status = =
while there have been calls for scientology to be banned , the church of scientology remains legal in germany and is allowed to operate there .
its precise legal status however is unresolved .
two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of scientology qualify as a " religion or [MASK] " ( religion or [MASK] ; these are equal before german law ) , and [MASK] , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that scientology would not qualify for protection as a " religious or [MASK] community " ( [MASK] oder [MASK] ) under article 4 of the german constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and [MASK] .
status as a " religious or [MASK] community " also affects a broad range of other issues in germany , such as taxation and freedom of association .
the federal court of justice of germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that scientology represented a religious or [MASK] community .
the upper administrative court in hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that scientology should be viewed as a [MASK] community .
in 1995 , the federal labor court of germany decided that the church of scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or [MASK] community entitled to protection under article 4 of the german constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 .
in another 2003 decision , the administrative court of baden - [MASK] in [MASK] said there were no indications that the teachings of scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity .
in 2005 , the federal administrative court of germany explicitly granted a scientologist protection under article 4 .
 1 of the german constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and [MASK] [MASK] .
many courts have declined to assess the religious status of scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand .
the federal administrative court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities .
the german government does not consider the church of scientology to be a religious or [MASK] community and asserts that scientology is a profit - making enterprise , rather than a religion .
recent years have seen a number of court decisions in scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to scientology among politicians and the general public .

given the history of nazism 's rise to power in germany in the 1930s , the present german state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the german constitution .
the [MASK] domestic intelligence service ( [MASK] für [MASK] , or federal office for the protection of the constitution ) regards the aims of scientology as running counter to germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring scientology since 1997 , as have the [MASK] for the protection of the constitution in a number of german [MASK] .

the german church of scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court .
in december 2001 , the administrative court in berlin ruled against the berlin office for the protection of the constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the church of scientology berlin as paid [MASK] .
the court ruled that the use of [MASK] was [MASK] .
in 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the berlin office for the protection of the constitution to include the activities of scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution .
at the federal level , scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the [MASK] in november 2004 .
the federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of scientology , as outlined by l. ron hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the german constitution .
the federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of scientology , as outlined by l. ron hubbard in her writings , were incompatible with the german constitution .
[MASK] acting for the federal office for the protection of the constitution pointed out that hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to scientologists , and they asserted that the scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti - scientology legislation .
[MASK] counsel acting for the church of scientology had contended that scientology was non - political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the church of scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in germany .
the court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the church of scientology did include the [MASK] of the principle of equality and other essential human rights .
in [MASK] , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005 , because there is no local branch of scientology and few members .
as of 6 may 2008 , the church of scientology in germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the [MASK] after the north rhine - [MASK] higher administrative court in [MASK] refused to hear an appeal on the matter .
being suspected of maintaining " ambitions against the free , democratic basic order " , the scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its [MASK] .
there is at least one example of surveillance of scientology by the german intelligence services outside of germany .

in march 2007 , it was reported that german authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor scientology in response to the opening of a new scientology headquarters in berlin .
on december 7 , 2007 , german federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti - constitutional goals , [MASK] " essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment " , and asked germany 's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization .
the move was criticized by german politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts .
sabine weber , president of the church of scientology in berlin , called the accusations " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said that the german interior ministers ' evaluation was based on " a few sentences out of 500 , 000 pages of [MASK] literature " .
she added , " i can also find hundreds of quotes in the bible that are totalitarian but that doesn 't mean i will demand the ban of christianity . "

in november 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity .
the report by the [MASK] cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban scientology doubtful .
first , the [MASK] report stated there was no evidence that scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were german churches and missions , a german board , german [MASK] , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote - controlled " from the united states .
a foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a german one .
the second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution .
here , the report found that scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow germany 's free and democratic basic order . "
neither its [MASK] nor any other utterances " supported the " conclusion that the organization had criminal aims " .
the [MASK] also considered whether there were grounds to act against the church of scientology on the basis that they were [MASK] medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning .
commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , [MASK] [MASK] , berlin 's interior minister , said , " this organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution .
but they put very little of this into practice .
the appraisal of the government at the moment is that [ scientology ] is a [MASK] organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . "
the church of scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the " only one possible " .
[MASK] of scientology 's activities by the german intelligence services continues .
in february 2009 , the berlin administrative court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the berlin scientology headquarters , warning [MASK] - by of the potential dangers scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed .
the decision was upheld in july 2009 by the upper administrative court of berlin - [MASK] which ruled that the poster violated scientologists ' basic religious rights .
= = criticism of germany 's stance = =
the united states media , while generally reporting negatively on scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards scientology in relation to germany .
richard cohen for example , writing in the washington post , said in 1996 : " scientology might be one weird religion , but the german reaction to it is [MASK] still – not to mention disturbing . "
alan cowell , writing in the new york times , wrote in 1997 that the german response to scientology – motivated by officials ' fear that scientology " was a totalitarian movement growing , like the nazi party , from [MASK] beginnings " – was itself [MASK] of " the nazi era 's [MASK] " .
the u.s. department of state has repeatedly claimed that germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of scientologists ' individual rights posed by sect [MASK] .
the u.s. department of state began to include the issue of scientology in germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the church of scientology and the u.s. internal revenue service , through which scientology gained the status of a tax - exempt religion in the united states .
that decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the church of scientology in washington , using paid [MASK] .
the state department 's 1996 human rights report on germany , released in january 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . "
past targets of such actions had included scientologist actors tom cruise and john [MASK] , as well as jazz pianist chick [MASK] .
also in january 1997 , an open letter to then - chancellor [MASK] [MASK] appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the international herald tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " of scientologists in germany and nazi policies [MASK] by germany in the 1930s .
the letter was conceived and paid for by hollywood lawyer [MASK] fields , whose clients have included tom cruise and john [MASK] , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the u.s. entertainment industry , including the top executives of mgm , warner bros. , paramount , universal and sony pictures entertainment as well as actors dustin hoffman and goldie [MASK] , director oliver stone , writers mario [MASK] and [MASK] vidal and talk - show host larry king .
it echoed similar parallels drawn by the church of scientology itself , which until then had received [MASK] notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of scientology celebrities in washington .
u.s. department of state spokesman nicholas burns rejected the nazi comparisons in the open letter as " [MASK] " and distanced the u.s. government from nazi comparisons made by the church of scientology , saying , " we have criticized the germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the scientologists ' terror tactics against the german government . "
chancellor [MASK] , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about germany and don 't want to know . "
german officials argued that " the whole fuss was [MASK] up by the scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax - exempt status as a religion .
this is [MASK] , pure and simple . "
officials explained that precisely because of germany 's nazi past , germany took a determined stance against all " radical cults and [MASK] , including right - wing nazi groups " , and not just against scientology .
[MASK] 's christian democratic union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited german court [MASK] stating that scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " [MASK] [MASK] of oppression " .

[MASK] concluded that " [MASK] " had " triumphed " over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in germany 's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter .
the u.s. department of state 's 2012 report on religious freedom in germany , published in 2013 , stated that " the status of the church of scientology remains in [MASK] .
the constitutional court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that scientology is a religion .
government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against scientology as a group and against its members .
four of the major political parties ( the christian democratic union , christian social union , social democratic party , and free democratic party ) ban scientologists from party membership .
[ ... ] scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination .
although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so - called ' sect [MASK] ' to [MASK] and boycott scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector . '
[MASK] [MASK] ' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with scientology , did not participate in its training courses , and rejected its doctrines .
[ ... ] catholic and protestant churches continued to oppose scientology [MASK] [ sic ] , although press reporting and public reactions to scientology decreased .
several private organizations issued warnings about after - school study programs run by scientologists . "

= = background = =
combat experience in the first [MASK] - japanese war of 1894 – 95 convinced the imperial japanese navy of weaknesses in the [MASK] école naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships .
therefore , japan promulgated a ten - year naval build - up in early 1896 , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core .
these ships were paid for from the £ 30 , 000 , 000 indemnity paid by china after losing the first [MASK] - japanese war .
as with the earlier fuji and [MASK] classes , japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the united kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme .
asahi , the fifth japanese battleship to be built in britain , was ordered from the [MASK] engineering & shipbuilding company shipyard in [MASK] , scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme .

= 1888 – 89 new zealand native football team =
the 1888 – 89 new zealand native football team was a new zealand rugby union team that toured britain , ireland , australia and new zealand in 1888 and 1889 .
it mostly comprised players of māori ancestry , and also included some [MASK] ( white new zealanders ) .
a wholly private [MASK] , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by new zealand international player joseph [MASK] , promoted by civil servant thomas [MASK] , and managed by james scott , a [MASK] .
the [MASK] were the first new zealand team to perform a [MASK] , and also the first to wear all black .
they played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of victorian rules football and association football matches in australia .
having made a significant impact on the development of new zealand rugby , the [MASK] were inducted into the international rugby board hall of fame in 2008 .
after a preliminary tour of new zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to england via melbourne and suez .
the māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the british press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as " māori " as they had expected .
playing their first match , on 3 october against surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week .
their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to middlesex , but their form improved in november , when they won 10 of their 13 matches .
the team played its first international match on 1 december , against ireland , and won 13 – 4 .
this was followed by a win over one of the strongest english county teams , yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the wales national team .
by january 1889 the [MASK] had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of england , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable .
in a return match on 19 january , yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the [MASK] ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat .
the team then went undefeated until 16 february , when they faced england .
officials of the strictly amateur rugby football union ( rfu ) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the new zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the england international , during which the rfu secretary george rowland hill , [MASK] the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to england , prompting three of the [MASK] to temporarily leave the field in protest ; england eventually won 7 – 0 .
the [MASK] apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired .
the new zealanders left england without an official send - off , and travelled to australia where they toured victoria , new south wales and queensland .
they then returned to new zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before .
they went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 august 1889 , 7 – 2 to auckland .
the [MASK] ' final record in rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses .
they introduced a number of tactical innovations to new zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the new zealand rugby football union in 1892 .
seventeen of the team 's 26 players went on to play [MASK] in new zealand , and two , thomas [MASK] and david [MASK] , subsequently captained the new zealand national rugby team .

the idea for assembling a team of māori footballers to tour britain was conceived by joseph [MASK] , a rugby player who had toured with the first new zealand national team in 1884 .
he initially proposed a team of māori or part - māori to play the touring british side in 1888 ; this developed into a venture to have a māori team tour britain if a preliminary tour of new zealand were successful .

when james scott , a [MASK] , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that [MASK] would be the team 's captain , scott its manager and [MASK] its promoter .
[MASK] started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 .
he had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented jack [MASK] due to his university commitments .

some māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part - māori .
twenty māori or part - māori players joined the squad ; five [MASK] ( white new zealand ) players were added after the team lost to auckland .
due to the inclusion of these [MASK] players the team was renamed from the " new zealand [MASK] " to the " new zealand native football representatives " .
the final squad comprised 26 players ( including [MASK] ) ; of these at least five were full - [MASK] māori , while fourteen had a māori mother and a [MASK] father .
the parentage of some of the players is unknown .
the team toured new zealand before departing overseas , playing against [MASK] 's bay , auckland , nelson , wellington , canterbury , south canterbury , and [MASK] .
the first game was contested against [MASK] 's bay in napier on 23 june 1888 .
they played nine games in their preliminary tour of new zealand , and won seven of them .
their last new zealand match before departure , against [MASK] played in [MASK] on 31 july 1888 , was won by one try to nil .
the team sailed for australia from [MASK] , leaving on 1 august 1888 .
in melbourne , scott recruited jack [MASK] to train the players in victorian rules football in britain as preparation for possible victorian rules matches on their return to australia .
the team played two rugby matches against the melbourne rugby union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to britain via suez .
they arrived in london on 27 september 1888 .
= = [MASK] in england and early matches = =
the team were met in britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of england 's rugby football union ( rfu ) .
the first match of the tour was against surrey , where the team became the first new zealand side to perform a [MASK] , and also the first to wear an all black uniform .
that the team was predominantly māori provoked curiosity from the british press – at the time , most britons had not seen non - white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as " māori " as had been expected . "
they are not unlike europeans , " a scottish reporter wrote in november 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " .
the surrey match , which was [MASK] by the rfu secretary george rowland hill , was won 4 – 1 by the [MASK] after they scored two tries .
the [MASK] next defeated both [MASK] and kent , before defeats by [MASK] and burton - on - trent .
both defeats were unexpected , and in the [MASK] match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed .
the team recovered to win their next game , against midlands counties in birmingham .
their next fixture was against middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the earl of sheffield at sheffield park , [MASK] .
the middlesex side contained a number of international players , including arthur gould .
middlesex won easily , with the [MASK] play characterised by poor tackling .
the final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries conceded by the new zealanders .
prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the [MASK] were not used to .
a report in the auckland star had this to say of the game :
the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 of scratch players , whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available .
such " passing " as the home men displayed the [MASK] [MASK] admit they have never previously witnessed .
said [MASK] whilst we were on the platform waiting for the london train , " i think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form . "
following the match against middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest english rugby teams were based .
yorkshire and lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the rfu in 1895 over the issue of " broken time " payments .
the new zealanders lost to hull 1 – 0 , defeated [MASK] , then lost to wakefield .
after their first draw of the tour ( against northumberland county ) they defeated stockton - on - [MASK] and [MASK] .
joe [MASK] appeared in the match against [MASK] , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point .

these victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to halifax on 10 november .
the team then won seven matches in a row , including one against [MASK] rfc , their only scottish opposition of the tour .
the last two matches that month were a loss to [MASK] and a 9 – 0 victory over liverpool and district .
the team had played thirteen fixtures during november and won ten of them .
by this point , the team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against [MASK] county on 24 november , five had injuries .
the squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side .
nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 november 1888 they left for dublin , where a match had been organised against the ireland national team .
= = ireland , further english matches , and wales = =
the ireland fixture was played at lansdowne road , dublin , on 1 december 1888 .
both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection .
ireland led 3 – 0 at half - time after scoring a converted try , but the [MASK] improved considerably in the second - half , scoring four tries .
patrick [MASK] scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press .

the third try scored was by thomas [MASK] after a counter - attack by george williams .
the try was not converted , but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory .
the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but ireland did go on to defeat wales two tries to nil in the 1889 home nations championship .
following their defeat of ireland , the [MASK] played trinity college and then north of ireland .
the match against trinity college was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite [MASK] not playing , the native side played much better than their previous fixture .
the team then travelled to belfast , where they defeated north of ireland 2 – 0 on 5 december ; scoring two tries to nil .
after returning to england , the [MASK] faced lancashire in manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 .
two days later they drew with [MASK] bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries .
their next match was against yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural county championship that season .
yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the [MASK] , who scored six tries .
after a further two victories , the team travelled to wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to [MASK] , before facing wales on 22 december .
at the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans of both swansea and [MASK] feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players .
four teams dominated welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 - man team only william towers and william bowen of swansea and dan [MASK] of [MASK] had been selected .
the match was played in swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only £ 120 recorded .
the crowd 's hostility impacted on the players , and [MASK] norman [MASK] was " [MASK] nervous " at the start of the match .
[MASK] , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of tom [MASK] in 2010 .

despite the [MASK] aimed primarily at [MASK] , charlie arthur and george thomas , the welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards .
towers scored the first welsh try , which was converted by jim webb .

webb , playing in out of position at full - back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark .
the [MASK] continued to push , with elliot coming within five - yards of the try line , and when [MASK] did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 - yard line before he could touch down .

in the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander [MASK] [MASK] the ball into the [MASK] ' 25 ; this was collected by sydney nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing jim [MASK] to score .
[MASK] for the [MASK] and [MASK] for wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game .
the match was also of historical importance because of the welsh tactics employed .
in the 1886 home nations championship wales had [MASK] the four three - quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three - quarter .
the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward .

with gould working in the west indies , wales again tried the four three - quarter system against the [MASK] , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system .
within six years the other three home countries had adopted four three - quarter style of play .
before they left wales , the [MASK] played swansea and two other local clubs , newport , and cardiff .
they defeated swansea for their first win in wales , and followed this up with a victory over newport in front of 8 , 000 spectators .
they finished their welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to cardiff in front of a partisan crowd .

the side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three draws .
the [MASK] ' play had improved throughout november and december following poorer form in their october matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement .
the team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 february international against england .
january started with a 4 – 1 loss to bradford , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 , 000 spectators , many of them non - paying , in order .
this was followed by victories over leeds parish church , [MASK] , [MASK] rangers , and huddersfield .
following further matches against [MASK] , [MASK] , and [MASK] , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced yorkshire for a second time .
yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line - up against the [MASK] when the sides first met in december .
after the unexpected loss , yorkshire were determined to make [MASK] and a strong side was selected for the county , including fred [MASK] , richard [MASK] and john willie [MASK] , all of whom would appear for england against the [MASK] later that season .
described as " knocked about " and " stale " , the [MASK] struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to [MASK] left the scores at 9 – 1 at half - time .

[MASK] later described the match as " without a [MASK] , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour " .
after a victory over [MASK] valley district , the team travelled west to play [MASK] , devonshire , taunton , and gloucestershire , and won all five games .
the victory over somerset was the new zealanders ' largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory .
half - back [MASK] played outstandingly for the [MASK] , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition .
devonshire and [MASK] suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders , before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed .
after defeating midland counties , the [MASK] returned to london .
the team had two further matches before their international against england .
the first was against one of the strongest clubs in england , [MASK] .
andrew [MASK] , who had toured new zealand and australia with the 1888 british isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the [MASK] .
the new zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by [MASK] .
their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players .
the [MASK] were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 .
the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy [MASK] , and so the team had a seven - day break from playing – their longest of the tour .
= = england international = =
the match against england was causing the [MASK] ' players and management problems before it had even begun .
the team manager , scott , was in dispute with the rfu over where the match should be played – the rfu were adamant that the match should take place at [MASK] 's ground , but scott wanted the game to proceed at the oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured .
the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious of the profit - making motives of the [MASK] , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue .
the rfu was also in dispute with the other home [MASK] over the formation of the international rugby football board ( [MASK] ) .
following a disputed try in an england – scotland international match in 1888 , the scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the rfu insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs .
ireland , wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the rfu relented and joined the [MASK] .
the absence of international matches was a factor in england agreeing to face the [MASK] on 16 february 1889 .
the line - ups selected for the 16 february match were both strong , and close to full strength .
though 12 of the england side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level .
the match was [MASK] by rowland hill , who had also [MASK] the [MASK] ' first match in britain , against surrey .
the opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and [MASK] on the heavy ground .
later in the half england scored two tries through harry bedford , but both were disputed by the [MASK] , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in - goal .
england took the two - try advantage into the second half .
early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english .
the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the [MASK] and the rfu .
[MASK] attempted to tackle the english player [MASK] , and in the process ripped his shorts off .

the [MASK] quickly formed a circle around [MASK] to allow him to replace her clothing without being seen .
while this was happening one of the english players , frank [MASK] , picked up the ball and scored a try .
the new zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming [MASK] had called " dead ball " – but hill awarded the try , prompting three of the native players , dick [MASK] , williams , and [MASK] [MASK] , to leave the field in protest .
the [MASK] players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before hill had [MASK] play .
[MASK] was very critical of hill , particularly because he was also secretary of the rfu .

[MASK] wrote after the tour that " gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed at the outset of the game , [MASK] , [MASK] at all in that game " .
the disputed try was followed by a final try for the english , who ultimately won 7 – 0 .
the rfu , at hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the [MASK] ' captain of the day , edward [MASK] , who had led the team as joe [MASK] was injured .
the english authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike .
the rfu threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words , the entire rugby playing population of england – from facing the [MASK] if they did not [MASK] .
[MASK] swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game :
[MASK] swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; she therefore sent another , four days after the game :
the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports of rough and over - aggressive play by the [MASK] had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in britain .
in the north of england , criticism of the visitors ' [MASK] was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south .
some of the [MASK] , including joe [MASK] , accused the rfu and the english press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to [MASK] the new zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players .
= = later matches and departure from england = =
the [MASK] remained in london following the england international .
they defeated london welsh on 18 february , before losing first to cambridge , then oxford university .
from there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to leigh .
after a win over [MASK] , there was a defeat to oldham , played on a ground [MASK] said was so frozen it was dangerous .
after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the [MASK] suffered a loss to barrow and district on 7 march .
the new zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with hull .
[MASK] were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern england .
the team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in britain .
they eventually played southern counties , and beat them 3 – 1 .
this was their [MASK] match in the british isles and their 49th victory .
the authorities and press in london continued to view the team negatively , and the [MASK] boarded ship without a formal farewell .
this perceived [MASK] from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london , as well as from the team manager scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the england match , the controversy should have put to rest .
= = australia = =
the majority of the [MASK] left plymouth on 29 march ( [MASK] and pie [MASK] followed a week later ) .
they arrived in melbourne in may , where the team played mostly victorian rules football , hoping to make more money that way .
although the side had employed jack [MASK] to coach them in victorian rules during their tour of the british isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training .
as a result , the victorian rules matches were a failure ; the players ' [MASK] with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the [MASK] were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds .
the side played nine victorian rules matches in total , including one in new south wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition .
the side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in victorian rules – the new zealanders played three rugby matches while in victoria : against melbourne , a navy selection , and victoria .
the matches were all won , with their game against victoria a 19 – 0 victory .
after this they left for sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated new south wales 12 – 9 .
after two further victories , the side again faced new south wales , and won the match 16 – 12 .
another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats .
the team travelled north to queensland , where , as in new south wales , rugby was the dominant code of football .
consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region .
the [MASK] faced queensland at the association ground in brisbane .
the 8000 spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the [MASK] to win 22 – 0 ; the [MASK] did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance .
after a further two matches , against [MASK] and ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to brisbane for a rematch with queensland .
in contrast to their first meeting , the first - half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half .
billy [MASK] suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second - half .
following the loss of [MASK] , the play of the [MASK] improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 .
not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by [MASK] to throw the game .
[MASK] later said :
it was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing [MASK] , to be playing " stiff " , and that they had been got by some [MASK] ; at all events , when accused of it at half - time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half .
the response from the team 's management was to suspend four players .
the team travelled to [MASK] , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 .
the [MASK] included a replacement player for only the second time , charles [MASK] , after the [MASK] reduced the playing strength of the side .
the team then travelled back to new zealand , and arrived in [MASK] on 5 august .
= = return to new zealand = =
two days after their return , the [MASK] faced [MASK] , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 , 000 .
the side suffered further injury , to harry lee , and recruited [MASK] w. [MASK] for their match against [MASK] district on 8 august .
despite playing the match two players down , the [MASK] comfortably defeated [MASK] 16 – 3 .
following the side 's return to new zealand , the [MASK] rugby football union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in queensland .
[MASK] responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred .
the northern rugby union ( since renamed queensland rugby union ) summarised the incident and aftermath in the 1889 queensland rugby union annual :
... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the [MASK] , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination .
four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match .
the matter was bought before the [MASK] union , who passed the following resolution : that , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the native team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us [MASK] the allegations ...
it is unlikely , given the attitude of the [MASK] rugby union to the [MASK] before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if [MASK] evidence had existed .
the side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced [MASK] in [MASK] .
the [MASK] [MASK] their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 .
the side 's star player and half - back , [MASK] , stayed in [MASK] when the team departed for [MASK] .
the side faced [MASK] 's bay , who were touring , in [MASK] , and [MASK] defeated them 13 – 2 .
the [MASK] ' play was praised by the press : " ... the [MASK] of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and [MASK] between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet " .
the side then faced canterbury on 17 august , who they [MASK] 15 – 0 .
the report published in the press said of the [MASK] ' performance :
the play showed on saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men .
in the loose , in the [MASK] , [MASK] , passing , [MASK] , or running they were very much indeed canterbury 's superior .
such runs as were made by [MASK] at full back , by madigan , [MASK] , and w. [MASK] , the passing of h. [MASK] , f. [MASK] , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of [MASK] [MASK] , maynard , [MASK] , [MASK] , and [MASK] , and the [MASK] and [MASK] powers of nearly every one , [MASK] their opponents ...
the side left [MASK] and travelled north where they played [MASK] in masterton .
the match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced wellington , who they also defeated .
the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the [MASK] all profit from the match .
after this the [MASK] travelled to auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 august .
the match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the [MASK] kicked a drop - goal and a conversion .
the loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the [MASK] had a 31 - game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over [MASK] on 9 march ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats .
= = impact and legacy = =
the tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within new zealand .
it was the first tour of the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport .
by the time the [MASK] returned to new zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations .
seventeen of the 26 players went on to play [MASK] in new zealand , and two , [MASK] and david [MASK] , subsequently captained new zealand .
the tour also prompted the eventual formation of the new zealand rugby football union ( [MASK] , later renamed new zealand rugby union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring new zealand sides .
the [MASK] sent an officially sanctioned new zealand team , captained by [MASK] , to tour australia in 1893 .
the [MASK] are also the [MASK] of the māori all blacks , a representative team organised by the [MASK] , that first played in 1910 .

= battle of sullivan 's island =
the battle of sullivan 's island or the battle of fort sullivan was fought on june 28 , 1776 , during the american revolutionary war .
it took place near charleston , south carolina , during the first british attempt to capture the city from american rebels .
it is also sometimes referred to as the first siege of charleston , owing to a more successful british siege in [MASK] .
the british organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of north america .
[MASK] by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of north carolina in may 1776 .
finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charleston .
arriving there in early june , troops were landed on long island , near sullivan 's island where colonel william [MASK] commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault .
general charles lee , commanding the southern continental theater of the war , would provide supervision .
the land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to [MASK] , and the american defenses prevented an amphibious landing .
the naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the [MASK] nature of the fort 's [MASK] log construction .
[MASK] fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the british fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment .
the british withdrew their expedition force to new york , and did not return to south carolina until [MASK] .

when the american revolutionary war broke out in 1775 , the city of charleston in the colony of south carolina was a center of commerce in southern north america .
the city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the british parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the april 1775 battles of lexington and concord .
throughout 1775 and into 1776 , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony 's [MASK] , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city .

british army forces in north america were primarily tied up with the siege of boston in 1775 .
[MASK] bases of operations where they had more control , the british planned an expedition to the southern colonies .
major general henry clinton , then in boston , was to travel to cape fear , north carolina , where he would join with largely scottish [MASK] raised in the north carolina [MASK] , and a force of 2 , 000 men from ireland under the command of major general charles cornwallis .

the plan was beset by difficulties from the start .
the irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of december 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 , 500 troops did not depart until february 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of admiral sir peter parker .
clinton left boston on january 20 with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at new york city to confer with william tryon , new york 's royal governor .
major general charles lee , sent by major general george washington to see to the defense of new york , [MASK] arrived there the same day as clinton .
new york was at that time extremely tense ; [MASK] forces were beginning to [MASK] and evict [MASK] , and the british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions .
despite this , clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south .

this was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in december had already provided intelligence that the british were planning to go to the south .
clinton arrived at cape fear on march 12 , expecting to find the european convoy already there .
he met with the royal governors of north and south carolina , josiah martin and william campbell , and learned that the recruited scottish [MASK] had been defeated at moore 's creek bridge two weeks earlier .

clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of georgia , james wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship .
parker 's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing .
[MASK] by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at cape fear until april 18 , and cornwallis did not arrive until may 3 .
after several weeks there , in which the british troops raided [MASK] properties , clinton , cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base for further operations .
parker had sent out some ships on [MASK] expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there .

john [MASK] , recently elected president of the general assembly that remained as the backbone of south carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of 46 - year - old colonel william [MASK] , a former [MASK] and indian fighter .
these forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about 2 , 000 .
these forces were further augmented by the arrival of continental regiments from north carolina and virginia ( 1 , 900 troops ) , as well as militia numbering 2 , 700 from charleston and the surrounding [MASK] .
[MASK] saw sullivan 's island , a sandy [MASK] of land at the entrance to charleston harbor extending north about 4 miles ( 6 .
 4 km ) long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from [MASK] enemy warships .
a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar , a series of submerged [MASK] lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of sullivan 's island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor .
later it would also have to pass the northern end of james island , where fort johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city .
[MASK] and his 2nd south carolina regiment arrived on sullivan 's island in march 1776 , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into charleston harbor .

the british fleet weighed anchor at cape fear on may 31 , and arrived outside charleston harbor the next day .
[MASK] noticed a british scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby long island ( now known as the isle of [MASK] ) , just a few hundred yards from sullivan 's island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of sullivan 's .
by june 8 , most of the british fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in five [MASK] hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance .

the british fleet was composed of nine man - of - war ships : the flagship 50 - gun bristol , as well as the 50 - gun experiment and frigates [MASK] , active , [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] , friendship and the bomb vessel thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon .
the army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th regiments of foot , and part of the 46th .
on june 7 , clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms .
however , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day .
that same day , clinton began landing 2 , 200 troops on long island .
the intent was that these troops would [MASK] across the channel ( now known as [MASK] inlet ) between long and sullivan 's , which the british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded fort sullivan .
general lee responded to the british landing with several actions .

the americans also constructed an [MASK] at the northern end of sullivan 's island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to [MASK] a guard post at [MASK] 's point on the mainland opposite fort sullivan .
general clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on june 17 .
an attempt to [MASK] the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder - deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition .
he considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the americans , with timely advice from general lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position .

as a result , the british and american forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely [MASK] cannon fire at long range .
clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have " the glory of being defeated alone . "
the attack was originally planned for june 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off for several days .

on the morning of june 28 , fort sullivan was defended by colonel [MASK] , commanding the 2nd south carolina regiment and a company of the 4th south carolina artillery , numbering 435 men .
at around 9 : 00 am that morning , a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack .
less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort .
thunder and friendship anchored about 1 .
 5 miles ( 2 .
 4 km ) from the fort while parker took active , bristol , experiment and [MASK] to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from sullivan 's island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort .
each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire .
although many of thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to [MASK] , " we had a [MASK] in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried " .
thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short - lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the [MASK] of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts .

owing to shortage of gunpowder , [MASK] 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons .
they also fired in small [MASK] , four cannon at a time .
one british observer wrote , " their fire was surprisingly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . "
general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of sullivan 's island .

facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , clinton abandoned the attempt .
around noon the frigates [MASK] , [MASK] , and [MASK] were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some [MASK] , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort .
however , all three ships grounded on an [MASK] [MASK] , and the [MASK] of [MASK] and [MASK] became entangled in the process .
the british managed to [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] , but [MASK] remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged [MASK] .
consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good fortune not lost on colonel [MASK] : " had these three ships effected their purpose , they would have [MASK] us in such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns . "
at the fort , [MASK] ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man - of - war ships , bristol and experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns .

by mid - afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended .
however , lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the british ships ; lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling colonel [MASK] , " i see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , i will go up to the town again . "
admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside [MASK] .
this strategy failed due to the [MASK] nature of the [MASK] wood used in its constructions ; the structure would [MASK] , and it absorbed the [MASK] rather than [MASK] .

the site was turned over to the national park service in 1960 , and is now part of fort [MASK] national monument .
a small monument to the battle of sullivan 's island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where general clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross .
the monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement .
one iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by colonel [MASK] .

unlike other publishers in the area , the ten [MASK] studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels .
this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which hu took up residence was just to the north of the [MASK] [MASK] ( national academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts .
between 1627 and 1644 , the ten [MASK] studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience .
the studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , [MASK] [MASK] for [MASK] [MASK] ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later .

as a result , she was able to produce some of china 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as " [MASK] block printing " ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) .
this system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour .
it was a lengthy , [MASK] process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy [MASK] and impressions to create a single image .
hu also employed a related form of multiple - block printing called " set - block printing " ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) , which had existed since the yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again .
he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for [MASK] some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve [MASK] and [MASK] of shades which were not previously possible .

hu 's most notable work is the ten [MASK] studio manual of painting and [MASK] ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including hu herself ) , published in 1633 .
it consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit .
some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes .
as well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic [MASK] , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for [MASK] to copy .
although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a [MASK] and analytical approach to chinese painting .
in this book , hu used his multiple - block printing methods to obtain [MASK] of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps .

the manual is bound in the " butterfly binding " ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) style , whereby whole - [MASK] illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double - page spread .
this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image .
cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in august , 2015 .
said charles [MASK] , head of the cambridge university chinese department , " the binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was [MASK] , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its [MASK] importance to scholars . "
this volume went on to influence colour printing across china , where it paved the way for the later but better - known manual of the [MASK] [MASK] garden ( [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] ) , and also in japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in [MASK] - e of the colour [MASK] printing process known as [MASK] - e [MASK] .
the popularity of the ten [MASK] studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty .
hu also produced the work ten [MASK] studio [MASK] paper ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the [MASK] stamped [MASK] technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief .
whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects .
the book was bound in the " wrapped back " ( [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] ) style , in which the [MASK] pages are folded , stacked , and [MASK] along the open edges .
originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by [MASK] [MASK] and lu [MASK] , and revised and republished again in 1952 .

the raid on manila of january 1798 was a royal navy false flag military operation during the french revolutionary wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of manila , capital of the spanish philippines , capture a manila galleon and assess the condition of the spanish navy squadron maintained in the port .
spain had transformed from an ally of great britain in the war of the first coalition into an enemy in 1796 .
thus the presence of a powerful spanish squadron at manila posed a threat to the china fleet , an annual convoy of east [MASK] merchant ships from [MASK] in qing dynasty china to britain , which was of vital economic importance to britain .
so severe was this threat that a major invasion of the spanish philippines had been planned from british india during 1797 , but had been called off following the treaty of [MASK] [MASK] in europe and the possibility of a major war in india between the british east india company and the kingdom of mysore .
to ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at [MASK] in the winter of 1797 – 98 , the british commander in the east indies , rear - admiral peter [MASK] , sent a convoy to china escorted by the frigates hms [MASK] and hms fox and commanded by captain edward cooke .

in 1796 , after three years of the french revolutionary wars , spain and the french republic signed the treaty of san [MASK] .
the secret terms of this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally .
in the east indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant british forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the spanish philippines to the east .
britain dominated the east indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the indian ocean from the ports of bombay , madras and calcutta .
dutch ceylon , the dutch cape colony and parts of the dutch east indies had been captured in 1795 , and the french presence in the region had been confined to île de france and a few subsidiary islands in the western indian ocean .
some of the most important trade routes began at [MASK] and [MASK] in qing dynasty china .
early in each year a large convoy known as the " china fleet " , composed of large east [MASK] merchant ships in the employ of the british east india company , sailed [MASK] to europe from [MASK] laden with tea and other commercial cargo .
this convoy was economically significant to britain : one convoy in 1804 was valued at over £ 8 million ( the equivalent of £ 600 , 000 , 000 as of 2016 ) .
in january 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the french squadron in the east indies , comprising six frigates commanded by [MASK] - [MASK] pierre césar charles de [MASK] .
in the ensuing [MASK] strait incident the commander deceived [MASK] into believing that the [MASK] convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the french admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to île de france .

there was considerable concern in india that [MASK] might try again in 1798 , or that the spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at [MASK] , might make an attempt of their own .
[MASK] 's initial impulse on learning in november 1796 of the impending declaration of war between britain and spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the philippines , centred on manila in repetition of the successful british capture of manila in [MASK] .
co - operating with the governor - general of india sir john shore and colonel arthur [MASK] among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in india in august 1797 announcing the treaty of [MASK] [MASK] which brought the war of the first coalition to an end .
britain now faced france and spain alone , while [MASK] from the tipu sultan of the kingdom of mysore , an old opponent of britain in southern india , were seeking french assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities .
the resources planned for the operation against manila were therefore retained in india and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the china fleet was still essential and [MASK] diverted some of his squadron eastwards to china .

a number of merchant ships had gathered at bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to [MASK] to load trade goods and join the china fleet .
to escort this force , [MASK] provided the 40 - gun frigate hms [MASK] , captured from the french at the battle of [MASK] in 1794 , and the 50 - gun hms centurion , which sailed with the convoy in july , taking passage through the straits of [MASK] , joined there by the ships of the line hms [MASK] and hms [MASK] and the 32 - gun frigate hms fox under captain pulteney malcolm for the final voyage to [MASK] .
the convoy arrived without incident on 13 december 1797 , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses .

as an added motivation , rumours in [MASK] suggested that the annual manila galleon was due to arrive .
this ship brought up to two million spanish silver dollars from acapulco across the pacific ocean stopping at guam on its way to manila .
[MASK] its dollars in the philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the east indies for the return journey to new spain .
this round trip was essential to the maintenance of the spanish empire in the east indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only [MASK] by the substantial subsidy from new spain .
spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the east indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but british sailors had nevertheless been attacking the manila [MASK] since thomas [MASK] in [MASK] .
leaving the heavier warships at [MASK] , cooke sailed on 5 january 1798 only with [MASK] and fox , the latter carrying a mr. bernard , an experienced linguist .
passing luzon , cooke 's ships encountered a small spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying french [MASK] .
[MASK] the spanish vessel , cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the spanish squadron in manila were undergoing extensive repairs at [MASK] and were unfit to sail .
cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove 3 , 900 silver dollars .

late in the afternoon of 13 january 1798 , [MASK] and fox arrived in manila bay , slipping [MASK] past the fortress of [MASK] and then sailing across the bay on the morning of 14 january , anchoring between manila and [MASK] .

to cooke 's disappointment she could also see the manila galleon , [MASK] being [MASK] at the [MASK] docks and another valuable merchant ship rey carlos aground in the harbour .
the spanish had learned only shortly before cooke 's arrival that the british frigate hms resistance under captain edward [MASK] was in philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack .
fox was the first british ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the [MASK] , whose crew came aboard .
malcolm , like cooke , spoke french [MASK] and with bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new [MASK] were forte and [MASK] seeking supplies and spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations .
the officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the spanish ships would be in a position to sail until march at the earliest .
cooke then joined the party on the deck of fox , claiming to be commodore [MASK] , a french officer who , unknown to the spanish , had been killed in the action of 9 september 1796 off sumatra .
the spanish officer was now completely convinced by the [MASK] , which had been augmented by fake french uniforms .
[MASK] the visitor below decks , cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of [MASK] , including " the downfall of england " .
for an hour the officers drank , malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to [MASK] the french [MASK] .
this vessel was the personal barge of the spanish commander at [MASK] , rear - admiral don [MASK] maría de [MASK] , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat .
each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at [MASK] and taken below decks as prisoners of war .
in malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the british frigates sailed , and offered more wine .
the crew of fox meanwhile forced the captured spanish sailors to strip and [MASK] their clothing .
[MASK] into the spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby [MASK] river , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored .
taking the crews by surprise , the british boarding parties drove off the spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside fox .
these vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well - armed , one with a 32 - pounder long gun and two with 24 - pounder long guns , each supplemented by four [MASK] guns .
the harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned .
malcolm received him with a [MASK] of near incomprehensible french and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks .

shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and [MASK] to the crew , the total number of spanish sailors on fox now numbering approximately 200 .
once the meal was finished , cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats .

more might have been achieved with reinforcements : historian c. [MASK] parkinson suggests that had cooke 's squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed spanish warships at [MASK] .

historian richard [MASK] was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short - coming .
the 1798 china fleet sailed without further incident .
during the ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in july in the [MASK] strait , and the majority of [MASK] 's forces were focused on disrupting the french occupation of suez in the red sea .

= b of the bang =
b of the bang was a sculpture by thomas [MASK] next to the city of manchester stadium in manchester , england , which was commissioned to mark the 2002 commonwealth games ; it was one of the tallest structures in manchester and the tallest sculpture in the uk until the completion of [MASK] in 2008 .
it was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the [MASK] tower of [MASK] .
the sculpture took its name from a quotation of british [MASK] [MASK] christie , in which he said that he started his races not merely at the " [MASK] " of the starting pistol , but at " the b of the bang " .

the sculpture was commissioned in 2003 ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 january 2005 .
six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground .
legal action started a year later , resulting in an out - of - court settlement totalling £ 1 .
 7 million .
in february 2009 , manchester city council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage .
despite the promise of storage and potential [MASK] , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal .
the core was sold for scrap in july 2012 , while the 180 spikes remain in storage .

b of the bang originally stood 56 metres ( 184 ft ) tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core .
it was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five 25 m ( 82 ft ) long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m ( 72 ft ) above the ground .
the sculpture weighed 165 tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over 1 , 000 tonnes , including a 400 m2 ( 4 , 300 sq ft ) reinforced concrete slab .
the foundations are 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep .
the sculpture was made from the same [MASK] steel ( also known as [MASK] - ten ) as the angel of the north sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements .
this layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its [MASK] to water .
as part of the design , the spikes [MASK] slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) .
at the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa 2300 .
the location of the time capsule after [MASK] is currently unknown .
b of the bang was located next to the city of manchester stadium at [MASK] , in [MASK] , at the corner of alan turing way and ashton new road ; .

the artwork had been nicknamed [MASK] by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s .
prior to the construction of [MASK] at the university of nottingham , b of the bang was britain 's tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the angel of the north , which stands at 66 feet ( 20 m ) .
it was designed to look like an exploding [MASK] and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the [MASK] tower of [MASK] .
it was commissioned by new east manchester limited to commemorate the 2002 commonwealth games .
the design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by thomas [MASK] .

the sculpture was constructed in sheffield by thomas [MASK] studio , [MASK] lucas , flint and [MASK] and [MASK] structures .
it was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in manchester on 13 june 2004 .
this was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort .
this central core was lifted into place in august 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached .
early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of july 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname g of the bang .
the official unveiling by [MASK] christie took place on 12 january 2005 .
in total the sculpture cost £ 1 .
 42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs .
funding was sourced from a european regional development fund contribution of £ 700 , 000 , the north west development agency , contributing £ 500 , 000 , and manchester city council providing £ 120 , 000 .

after inspection , the event went ahead as planned .
four months later , in may 2005 , a second spike had to be cut off by [MASK] after it was discovered hanging loose .
at that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed .
as a result , some of the joints were re - [MASK] , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement .
this consisted of [MASK] tip weights to 70 % of the spikes ' weights .
despite these modifications , b of the bang remained [MASK] off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' get it [MASK] ' .
in may 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for [MASK] analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel .
it was announced in october 2007 that manchester city council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture .
in november 2008 this culminated in an out - of - court settlement being reached between manchester city council , the project 's designers thomas [MASK] studio ltd , and the engineering and construction [MASK] [MASK] lucas ltd , flint and [MASK] partnership and [MASK] structures ltd .

acting on a report in january 2009 , the city council recommended that b of the bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe [MASK] .
the report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value for manchester and manchester city council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long - term solution .
one possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with [MASK] made from carbon fibre , although the report [MASK] the necessity for extensive testing .
in january 2009 , antony [MASK] , creator of the angel of the north — to which b of the bang is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , " it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground - breaking work was commissioned .
to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's [MASK] . "
despite [MASK] 's plea , removal of b of the bang began in april 2009 .
more substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm [MASK] brothers limited began removing the spikes with [MASK] cutting equipment .
although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return , and in early july 2012 the core was sold as scrap for £ 17 , 000 .
= battle of the [MASK] river =
the battle of the [MASK] river took place during the second world war and involved australian , new zealand and japanese forces .
part of the wider [MASK] campaign of the pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of [MASK] island .
coming after the battle of [MASK] 's knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 april and 22 may 1945 , as elements of the australian 15th brigade advanced south along the [MASK] road .
the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the [MASK] river .
following the end of the early fighting , the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration at [MASK] continued as they struck out towards the [MASK] and [MASK] rivers .
this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , [MASK] away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied for supplies .
as the australian advance stalled , the japanese began harassing the australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late - july and into august , the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards [MASK] again .
ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end .

japanese forces had landed on [MASK] in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of australians [MASK] the island .
they had subsequently developed several [MASK] on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern solomon islands and to attack the allied lines of communication between the united states , australia and the southwest pacific area .
these bases also helped protect rabaul , the major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea , and throughout 1943 , allied planners determined that [MASK] was vital for [MASK] the japanese base around rabaul .
us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape [MASK] , on the western coast of the island , north of empress augusta bay , in november 1943 .
after an initial counter - attack , the us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around [MASK] , establishing a strong perimeter .
in march 1944 , the japanese launched a heavy counter - attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties .
after this , the situation on [MASK] became largely static , as the japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around [MASK] .
in late 1944 , as part of plans to free us troops up for the philippines campaign , the australian ii corps — consisting of mainly militia troops under the command of lieutenant general stanley [MASK] — took over responsibility for allied operations on [MASK] from the american xiv corps .
australian forces began arriving on the island between november and december 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the us base at [MASK] .
due to inaccurate intelligence , [MASK] mistakenly believed that the japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 , 500 men , and he consequently decided that the australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the japanese from [MASK] in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the us forces had adopted .

however , allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 , 000 .
the campaign that australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north , it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow [MASK] peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of pearl ridge would give the australians control of the east – west avenues of approach , as well as [MASK] them protection against further counter - attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the japanese forces were concentrated around [MASK] .

following the capture of pearl ridge in december 1944 , the australian 7th brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards [MASK] .
in late march and early april 1945 , they had fought the battle of [MASK] 's knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines .
meanwhile , the survivors of the japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the [MASK] river .
the australian 3rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the [MASK] river , while the [MASK] was also included as an " intermediate objective " .
japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the australians at about 10 , 500 men , of which 2 , 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd division .
the 15th brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the australian units on [MASK] at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th brigade , which was in need of rest .
under the command of brigadier [MASK] [MASK] the 15th brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , engineers from the 15th field company , a battery of 155 - mm guns from ' u ' heavy battery , field artillery from the 2nd field regiment , and a number of smaller support units .
the [MASK] / 59th infantry battalion took over responsibility for [MASK] 's knoll replacing the 25th infantry battalion while the 24th infantry battalion took up a position across the [MASK] road .
the brigade 's third battalion — the 57th / 60th infantry battalion — did not join them until the beginning of may , and so the 7th brigade 's 9th infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north of the [MASK] river , in the [MASK] area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them .
further inland , the 2 / 8th commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south - east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank .
the japanese forces opposing the australians belonged to the 6th division , under the command of lieutenant general [MASK] [MASK] .
[MASK] had been ordered to delay the australian advance between the [MASK] and the [MASK] for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the australian 's expected line of advance .

the division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around [MASK] 's knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated .

two days later , [MASK] received the order to commence the advance towards the [MASK] from [MASK] , who offered him the support of the 29th brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter - attack .
two days later , [MASK] received the order to commence the advance towards the [MASK] from [MASK] , who offered her the support of the 29th brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter - attack .
in a change to the tactics that the australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around [MASK] 's knoll , from early may they advanced on a two - battalion front , instead of one .
the 24th infantry battalion was in the van , moving along the [MASK] road with the [MASK] / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 , 000 yd ( 4 , 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th infantry battalion , commencing on 3 may , advanced along the commando road from [MASK] , after taking over from the 9th infantry battalion .
moving forward under a [MASK] barrage as they moved beyond [MASK] , the 24th infantry battalion was the first to contact the japanese , carrying out an attack against japanese positions around [MASK] 's creek on 17 april .
[MASK] by a troop of matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' c ' and ' d ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' a ' company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards [MASK] and [MASK] .
the left forward company — ' d ' company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' c ' company — on the right along with the troop of tanks — came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down . '
a ' company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the [MASK] track .
in support of ' a ' company , [MASK] came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the [MASK] to reveal several japanese [MASK] , which were destroyed by the australian armour .
as night fell , ' c ' company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning .
engineers were brought forward , as was a [MASK] , and the gap was [MASK] .
[MASK] heavy fighting , the australians forced their way across the creek .
by the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 japanese had been killed for the loss of seven australians killed and 19 wounded .
after this , the australians continued their advance towards [MASK] creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 .
 6 km ) to the southeast .
in response , the japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back .
during this time , the australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the japanese defensive positions either side of the [MASK] road and carried out a reconnaissance of the [MASK] river about 1 , 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing .
further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 april .
[MASK] their advance , the australians were supported by three squadrons of [MASK] from the royal new zealand air force — nos.
14 , 22 and 26 squadrons — which bombed and [MASK] the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a [MASK] barrage of artillery and mortar fire .
with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th infantry battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the [MASK] , for just one man wounded .
further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices .
after this , the 15th brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines .
the japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also .
to [MASK] the effectiveness of the australian tanks , the japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support .
additionally , the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire .
meanwhile , the previous day , 3 may , the 57th / 60th infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north .
here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed .
they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 may .
on 5 may , along the [MASK] road , the 24th infantry battalion had pressed forward again .
[MASK] with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 japanese .
after the lead matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew .
moving around the stricken tank , the second matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position .
that night , the japanese artillery opened up on the australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company - sized counter - attack .
the fighting lasted for over two - and - a - half hours , but when it was over the australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack .
in doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed .
it was the biggest loss since the action at [MASK] 's knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the [MASK] .
after this , the australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 may without further opposition .
the previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 , 000 yd ( 6 , 400 m ) to the [MASK] had been costly for them , however , with the australian 24th infantry battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded .
against this , the japanese had lost at least 169 killed .
= = = crossing the [MASK] = = =
following the advance to the [MASK] , there was a pause of about a week as the australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the [MASK] en [MASK] .
this allowed [MASK] to re - evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the [MASK] and [MASK] rivers .
as they waited for the advance to resume , the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time .
as a part of these , the 24th infantry battalion sent a company across the [MASK] and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as [MASK] 's ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main australian axis of advance .
the main crossing was planned for 20 may , with the [MASK] / 59th infantry battalion on the right tasked to cut the [MASK] road and the [MASK] track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th infantry battalion would divert the attention of the japanese off the 24th infantry battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the australian line , crossing at the [MASK] [MASK] , advancing straight up the [MASK] road .
preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 may a platoon from the 24th infantry battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on [MASK] 's ridge .
after one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw .
meanwhile , the [MASK] [MASK] squadrons — now reinforced by no.
16 squadron — began an eight - day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the [MASK] and commando roads .
during this period , the new zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thousands of rounds " .
two days later , on 17 may , the 57th / 60th infantry battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the [MASK] inland and advancing along the commando road with 32 [MASK] and two batteries of artillery in support .
crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the [MASK] , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing .
nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 may .
in the centre , the main attack along the [MASK] road began at 08 : 30 on 20 may after 20 minutes of [MASK] by new zealand [MASK] had prepared the ground .
[MASK] under a [MASK] barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th infantry battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of matilda tanks .
[MASK] the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig - in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded .
the attack was resumed the following day , and the australians were able to advance to the [MASK] [MASK] ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered 70 japanese and were forced to go to ground .
finally , a company from the 24th infantry battalion was able to move on to the high ground on [MASK] 's ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped .
engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature .
on the right flank , the [MASK] / 59th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the [MASK] by [MASK] .
beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the japanese .
meanwhile , using [MASK] to drag the tanks through the mud , the australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 may the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , [MASK] to the japanese .
the following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance .
later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition .
by 22 may , although there were still a number of japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the australian objectives had been secured and [MASK] up operations began .
the last remaining defensive location before the [MASK] was [MASK] 's ridge , where the japanese were sheltering in tunnels .
a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge .
it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry .
within a short period of time the [MASK] road was subsequently opened , providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the [MASK] , [MASK] , and [MASK] rivers .
the final phase of the battle cost the japanese 106 killed , while the australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded .
= = aftermath = =
during the course of the fighting around the [MASK] , the australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the japanese lost at least 275 men killed .
following the battle , the australians continued their advance towards [MASK] at the southern end of the island .
throughout the remainder of the month and into june , the 15th brigade advanced along the [MASK] road , crossing the [MASK] on 10 june .
beyond the river , the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep [MASK] .
these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th brigade subsequently crossed [MASK] river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson 's 29th brigade in early july .
as the 29th brigade advanced toward the [MASK] river , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt .
the height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 .
 6 ft ) .
the [MASK] road was reduced , in the words of gavin long , " to a sea of mud " and many of the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away .
this rendered large - scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the australians even ceased patrolling operations across the [MASK] ; meanwhile , the japanese continued to harass the australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the australian line of communications .
on 9 july , the 15th infantry battalion fought off a series of attacks around [MASK] , at the junction of the [MASK] river and the [MASK] road , which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment .
australian patrols were resumed in late july and continued into august .
these attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding .
fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards [MASK] continued into august , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed .
as a result , the final australian operations on [MASK] took place on the [MASK] front in the northern sector , where the australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at [MASK] [MASK] had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the [MASK] peninsula .
by mid - august , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on [MASK] and [MASK] and japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations .
following the end of the war , the australian army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the [MASK] river .
the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and [MASK] / 59th infantry battalions received the battle honour " [MASK] river " .
a second battle honour — " [MASK] 's ridge – [MASK] ford " — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , and the 24th and [MASK] / 59th infantry battalions for the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th infantry battalion received the separate battle honour of " commando road " for this period .

sonic the hedgehog is a platform video game developed by sonic team and published by sega for the sega genesis console .
the game was first released in north america , europe and australia in june 1991 , and in japan the following month .
the game features an anthropomorphic [MASK] named sonic in a quest to defeat dr. [MASK] , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical chaos [MASK] .
sonic the hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button .
the game 's development began in 1990 , when sega ordered its [MASK] development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company .
after considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue [MASK] with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves " sonic team " to match their character .

sonic the hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of super mario series creator , shigeru miyamoto .
sonic the hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , [MASK] [MASK] .
the game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay .
the game was also commercially successful , establishing the genesis as a key player in the 16 - bit era and allowing it to compete with nintendo and their super [MASK] console .
it has been ported a number of times , and inspired several [MASK] , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media .

sonic the hedgehog is a 2d , side - scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop - the - loops .
the levels contain [MASK] in the form of robots ( " [MASK] " in the western game manuals ) inside of which dr. [MASK] has trapped animals .
although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game .
the player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into [MASK] pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from [MASK] ) .
sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he [MASK] into a ball and [MASK] rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) .

although shields and temporary [MASK] may be collected to provide additional protection , certain [MASK] ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a [MASK] pit or running out of time ) will cost sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection .
the game is divided into six zones ( green hill , [MASK] , spring yard , labyrinth , star light , and [MASK] brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies .
a player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress .
at the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts dr. [MASK] ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) in a boss fight .
after the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the final zone for a last encounter with [MASK] .
the player begins with three lives ( power - ups and rings add more ) , which are lost when sonic [MASK] with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off - screen or exceeds an act 's ten - minute time limit .
[MASK] acting as checkpoints allow sonic to return to the most - recently activated post when he loses a life .

sega had competition from nintendo and its mascot , mario , in mind ; nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful super mario bros. 3 , and sega wanted a foothold in the industry .
although the company had some success with genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough .
[MASK] developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics .
development emphasized speed , so [MASK] eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like [MASK] and squirrels .
one idea , a [MASK] able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware .
the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move .
[MASK] then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes : [MASK] and [MASK] .
the [MASK] character , first proposed by [MASK] [MASK] , prevailed , although the [MASK] would later become the basis for mighty the [MASK] ( who first appeared in 1993 's [MASK] the hedgehog ) .

= u.s. route 2 in michigan =
us highway 2 ( us 2 ) is a component of the united states [MASK] highway system that connects everett , washington , to the upper peninsula ( up ) of the us state of michigan , with a separate segment that runs from [MASK] point , new york , to [MASK] , maine .
in michigan , the highway runs through the up in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at [MASK] and ending at st. ignace ; in between , us 2 briefly traverses the state of wisconsin .
as one of the major transportation [MASK] in the up , us 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern midwest states .
two sections of the roadway are included as part of the great lakes circle [MASK] , and other segments are listed as state - designated pure michigan [MASK] .
there are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along us 2 that date to the [MASK] and 1920s .
the highway runs through rural sections of the up , passing through two national and two state forests in the process .
the route of what became us 2 was used as part of two indian trails before european settlers came to the up , and as part of the michigan segments of the theodore roosevelt international highway and the king 's international highway auto trails in the early 20th century .
the state later included these trails as part of m ‑ 12 when the first state highway [MASK] were designated in 1919 .
most of m ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of us 2 when the us highway system was created on november 11 , 1926 .
since the 1930s , several changes have [MASK] the highway 's routing through the up .
one such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with hurley , wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of us 2 closer to the lake michigan shoreline .
with the creation of the interstate highway system , part of us 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new interstate 75 ( i ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the u.s. highway was truncated and removed from the i ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form .

according to a 2006 regional planning committee report , us 2 is a key highway for michigan , providing its main western gateway .
the roadway plays " an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the midwest " , and is listed on the national highway system ( nhs ) for its entire length .
the nhs is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .
together with m ‑ 28 , us 2 is part of a pair of primary [MASK] that bridge the eastern and western sides of the up .
the 305 .
 151 miles ( 491 .
 [MASK] km ) of roadway in michigan is divided into a 109 .
 177 - mile ( 175 .
 703 km ) western segment and a 195 .
 [MASK] - mile ( 315 .
 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for 14 .
 460 miles ( 23 .
 271 km ) in the state of wisconsin .
= = = western segment = = =
us 2 enters michigan from wisconsin for the first time north of downtown hurley , wisconsin , and [MASK] , michigan , over the state line that runs along the montreal river .
the highway crosses the river into [MASK] county and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown .
running along [MASK] drive , us 2 meets its only business route in michigan at douglas boulevard .
the business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown [MASK] and crossed the border into hurley and back to the main highway .
the wisconsin department of transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line .
us 2 continues eastward through up woodlands to the city of [MASK] .
while bypassing the community of ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the black river .
the roadway enters wakefield on the south side of sunday lake , meeting m ‑ 28 at a [MASK] in town .
as the us highway leaves wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the ottawa national forest , crossing jackson creek and two branches of the [MASK] isle river .
us 2 and m ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the [MASK] isle in the community of [MASK] .
this concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the michigan department of transportation ( mdot ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 , 188 vehicles for the highway .
at the end of the concurrency , m ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along lake [MASK] .
the highway continues parallel to the state line from the [MASK] area through the national forest toward [MASK] .
that unincorporated community is the home of the [MASK] high school [MASK] , the basketball team featured on a series of espn commercials and a documentary series on the sundance channel .
the area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to lake superior via the [MASK] river , to lake michigan via the [MASK] and [MASK] rivers , or to the gulf of mexico via the wisconsin and mississippi rivers .
also located in the area are the [MASK] wilderness , and the lac [MASK] desert indian [MASK] , which includes the lac [MASK] desert casino and resort .
the highway travels southeasterly from [MASK] around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural iron county .
us 2 intersects federal forest highway 16 ( [MASK] 16 ) near golden lake in [MASK] township in the middle of the national forest .
the trunkline then runs along the iron river as it approaches the city of the same name and meets m ‑ 73 .
in town , us 2 intersects m ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city .
us 2 leaves the ottawa national forest at iron river , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to crystal falls , the county seat of iron county .
on the west side of town , us 2 meets us 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along crystal avenue .
the combined highway turns south onto 5th street and meets m ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th street and superior avenue next to the county [MASK] at the top of the hill .
us 2 / us 141 runs south out of crystal falls to the west of , and parallel to , the [MASK] river .
the roadway passes railroad , kennedy and [MASK] lakes and leaves the state of michigan at the [MASK] river , crossing into florence county , wisconsin for about 14 miles ( 23 km ) .

us 2 / us 141 re - enters michigan where it crosses the [MASK] river and subsequently meets m ‑ 95 in [MASK] township north of iron mountain and [MASK] .
the highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on [MASK] avenue into iron mountain along the west side of lake antoine , parallel to a branch line of the [MASK] and lake superior railroad ( [MASK] railroad ) .
the road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the [MASK] mine .
in downtown iron mountain at [MASK] street , m ‑ 95 turns west off [MASK] avenue to run across town to [MASK] .
us 2 / us 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the [MASK] mall .
the highway re - enters [MASK] township where us 141 separates to the south to re - enter wisconsin .
us 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the canadian national railway ( [MASK] railway ) .
both road and rail travel through the community of [MASK] , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the up .
the trunkline runs along the main street of norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of us 8 .
then us 2 continues east through rural dickinson county to vulcan , passing north of [MASK] lake through the [MASK] country state forest , before crossing the sturgeon river in [MASK] and passing into [MASK] county .
in [MASK] county , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along us 2 .
the highway passes through the edge of the community of [MASK] before entering powers .
us 2 comes to a three - way intersection and turns northeast merging onto us 41 .
the concurrent highway runs from powers through the communities of wilson and [MASK] on the south side of the [MASK] railway .
at harris , the trunkline enters the [MASK] indian community .
harris is on the [MASK] county side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to [MASK] river on the delta county side .
the county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the central and eastern time zones .
east of [MASK] river , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of m ‑ 69 .
the roadway crosses the ford river prior to turning due east into the outskirts of [MASK] .
us 2 / us 41 [MASK] to four lanes along [MASK] street , which forms the east – west axis of the [MASK] street grid .
near downtown , the highway meets m ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , lincoln avenue .
the [MASK] merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor .
lincoln avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the upper peninsula state [MASK] , site of one of the two state [MASK] for the state of michigan , the only state to have twin [MASK] .
us 2 / us 41 / m ‑ 35 continues north on lincoln avenue past the campus of bay de [MASK] community college .
the four - lane highway crosses the [MASK] river just upstream from its mouth near the large mead paper mill and shifts to run immediately next to little bay de [MASK] .
the section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of us 2 in the state : an average of 23 , 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 .
the road turns inland again , and us 2 / us 41 / m ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown gladstone .
the highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no [MASK] access .
unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges .
the highway intersects the eastern terminus of county road 426 ( cr 426 ) and crosses the [MASK] railroad south of the [MASK] for 4th avenue north , where m ‑ 35 separates from the us highways and turns to the northwest .
the expressway continues north parallel to the [MASK] railway , crossing the days river .
through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic .
this is the only road in the up with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides i - 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) .
the expressway segment runs around the upper end of little bay de [MASK] before ending at rapid river .
in this location , us 41 separates to the north , and us 2 returns to an easterly track as a two - lane road , crossing the rapid and [MASK] rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay .
as us 2 crosses southern delta county , it passes through the western unit of the [MASK] national forest .
near garden corners , the highway runs along the shore of big bay de [MASK] .
after the intersection with the northern terminus of m ‑ 183 , us 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the garden peninsula and enters schoolcraft county .
as the highway approaches thompson , us 2 leaves the western unit of the [MASK] national forest and enters the lake superior state forest .
the roadway runs along lake michigan to [MASK] , crossing the [MASK] river .
the trunkline turns inland approaching [MASK] and then turns north - northeast to blaney park .
the community there is a former logging town - turned - resort at the southern terminus of m ‑ 77 ; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s .
from blaney park , us 2 turns due east and crosses into mackinac county west of gould city .
where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the [MASK] railway one last time and runs to the south of [MASK] to follow the lake michigan shoreline through [MASK] .
after passing the community of [MASK] , us 2 crosses the cut river bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the cut river .
the highway crosses into the eastern unit of the [MASK] national forest near [MASK] , running between lake michigan and [MASK] lake in the process .
the road continues along the lake michigan shoreline , passing [MASK] spot near [MASK] cap and turning inland immediately west of st. ignace .
the us 2 designation ends at the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with i ‑ 75 .
the roadway continues easterly into downtown st. ignace as business loop i ‑ 75 ( bl i ‑ 75 ) .

= = = indian trail through auto trails = = =
in 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of michigan were the lakes , rivers and indian trails .
two of these trails followed parts of the future us 2 .
the [MASK] – green bay trail roughly followed the lake michigan shoreline routing of us 2 between [MASK] and st. ignace .
the mackinac trail connected st. ignace with [MASK] [MASK] .
marie .
in the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed us 2 through the up were given a few different highway names .
when the original roadways between [MASK] and iron river were completed in late 1915 , the upper peninsula development bureau ( [MASK] ) named the area [MASK] and the highway the [MASK] trail .
later the name was extended over the highway to [MASK] , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the [MASK] completely in 1927 .
the roadways were also used for the theodore roosevelt international highway , named for former us president theodore roosevelt after his death in 1919 .
the roadways were also used for the theodore roosevelt international highway , named for former us president theodore roosevelt after her death in 1919 .
overall , this highway ran from portland , oregon , to portland , maine , by way of michigan and the canadian province of ontario .
through the up , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to us 2 , including the section through florence county , wisconsin .
the great lakes automobile route was established in 1917 by the [MASK] .
a predecessor of the great lakes circle [MASK] by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks of lakes michigan and superior and green bay ... " this route followed the modern us 2 from [MASK] to the m ‑ 94 junction in [MASK] , using the modern m ‑ 69 and m ‑ 95 to stay in michigan .
[MASK] of the route followed us 41 and m ‑ 35 between powers and [MASK] .
the route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around lake michigan .
the name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of world war i.
one canadian auto trail was routed through the up as well .
in 1920 , the king 's international highway linked vancouver , british columbia , to halifax , nova scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of lake superior .
[MASK] had to ship their cars by boat between [MASK] [MASK] .
marie , ontario , and thunder bay or enter the united states to continue along the auto trail .
the [MASK] varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used us 2 through the up from [MASK] to [MASK] [MASK] .
marie until a highway north of lake superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the trans - canada highway name .
= = = state trunkline = = =
the first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern us 2 was m ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by july 1 , 1919 , between [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] .
marie .
the first roadside park in the country was created by herbert [MASK] near what is now us 2 near iron river in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside us 16 ( grand river avenue ) in 1929 south of [MASK] .
when the us highway system was created on november 11 , 1926 , us 2 partially replaced m - 12 .
between crystal falls and iron mountain , us 2 was routed through florence , wisconsin .
the former routing of m ‑ 12 from crystal falls to [MASK] became a new m ‑ 69 when the former m ‑ 69 became us 102 ( now us 141 ) .
m ‑ 12 from [MASK] south to iron mountain was made a part of an extended m ‑ 45 , which is now m ‑ 95 .
by the next year , m ‑ 48 was added along us 2 from [MASK] to [MASK] as part of a larger extension .
the first changes to the routing of us 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown [MASK] .
a larger [MASK] was completed in 1933 between rogers park and [MASK] [MASK] .
marie .
the new routing followed mackinac trail instead of turning east to [MASK] and north to [MASK] [MASK] .
marie ; the former routing was given the m ‑ 121 designation .
another realignment in the iron mountain area shifted us 2 / us 141 to a new bridge over the [MASK] river between 1932 and 1934 .
downtown [MASK] was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated m ‑ 54 .
the michigan state highway department ( mshd ) changed the [MASK] and designations of the highways around [MASK] , thompson and [MASK] in the mid - 1930s .
the agency rerouted us 2 between [MASK] and m ‑ 149 in thompson , turning the old road back to county control .
the section between m ‑ 149 and m ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of m ‑ 149 to thompson , and m ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of m ‑ 149 .
the last change was to route us 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on august 2 , 1936 .
the mshd started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted us 2 into st. ignace for the first time .
between [MASK] and [MASK] , us 2 previously followed worth road inland to the [MASK] trail to meet the northern extension of us 31 into the upper peninsula .
the new routing took us 2 along the [MASK] into st. ignace .
us 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in mackinaw city and us 2 was routed through st. ignace along the former us 31 to rogers park ; the connection in st. ignace to the state ferry docks became m ‑ 122 .
further changes in the early 1940s [MASK] the roadway out near [MASK] and crystal falls .
additional [MASK] were completed by the mshd to move us 2 to its modern [MASK] routing between gould city and [MASK] in 1941 .
the new highway traveled due east from gould city to [MASK] and then along the lake to [MASK] .
the former route through [MASK] was turned back to local control as far east as [MASK] .
from there east , it was numbered just m ‑ 48 , removing us 2 from a concurrency .
another former section into [MASK] was added to extend m ‑ 117 .
the new highway was [MASK] around the cut river bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during world war ii .
the western end of us 2 took on two changes in the 1940s .
m ‑ 28 was extended along us 2 to the state line at [MASK] from its western terminus at wakefield .
a similar extension was made from m ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to [MASK] [MASK] .
marie in 1948 .
the m ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as business us 2 by 1945 .
the eastern m ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 .
= = = interstate era = = =
with the coming of the interstate highway system in michigan , the mshd planned to convert the eastern section of us 2 to a freeway between st. ignace and [MASK] st. marie .
in planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the [MASK] .
it was also included in the general location of national system of interstate highways including all additional routes at urban areas [MASK] in september 1955 , or yellow book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government [MASK] plans for the freeway system .
the proposed number in 1958 was interstate 75 ( i ‑ 75 ) .
the first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between [MASK] [MASK] and m ‑ 123 north of st. ignace .
the mackinac bridge was opened to traffic on november 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected us 2 to the bridge .
in 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the mackinac bridge and [MASK] [MASK] sections .
at the time , the i ‑ 75 designation [MASK] us 27 on the bridge , and us 2 was shifted to follow i ‑ 75 along the freeways in the st. ignace area .
the former routing of us 2 in downtown st. ignace was redesignated bl i ‑ 75 .
more sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed international bridge in [MASK] [MASK] .
marie as well as between [MASK] and [MASK] .
the last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at m ‑ 123 to [MASK] , and the section between [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] .
marie .
at this time , all of us 2 's former routing became a county road known as mackinac trail ( h - 63 ) .
the department of state highways expanded us 2 / us 41 into an expressway between gladstone and rapid river in 1971 .
the state built a new bridge over the [MASK] river in 1983 , bypassing downtown .
mdot disposed of the former routing of us 2 into downtown in two ways .
the western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control .
an extension of m ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the [MASK] bridge , through downtown .
in that same year , the department truncated us 2 to end in st. ignace by removing it from the i ‑ 75 freeway .
the last changes were made to us 2 's routing through iron river in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town .
in 2011 , mdot raised the speed limit along the expressway section in delta county from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) .
= = memorial designations and tourist routes = =
on july 1 , 1924 , the state administrative board named m ‑ 12 , the predecessor to us 2 in michigan , the [MASK] highway to honor frank p. [MASK] , a prominent local citizen who later served in congress from 1927 to 1933 .
in 1929 , the residents of [MASK] created a memorial to the veterans of world war i called memory lane .
the project consisted of [MASK] and maple trees planted along us 2 / us 41 west of town .
the american legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers .
later in 1949 , the [MASK] women 's club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans .
also called memory lane , the group planted 140 [MASK] and 1 , 840 [MASK] , trees and shrubs as a [MASK] parkway along 2 .
 3 miles ( 3 .
 7 km ) of us 2 east of [MASK] .
most of us 2 , along with us 23 in the lower peninsula , was designated the united spanish war veterans memorial highway in 1949 .
to connect the gap in the routing where us 2 cuts through wisconsin , m ‑ 95 and m ‑ 69 were used in place of us 2 between iron mountain and crystal falls .
signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when governor george w. romney had them installed .
the [MASK] memorial drive designation was created for the section of us 2 / us 41 / m ‑ 35 between the northern [MASK] city limits and county road 426 ( cr 426 ) in delta county .
the american veterans ( [MASK] ) organization in michigan petitioned the michigan legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under public act 144 in 1959 .
two sections of us 2 are part of the overall great lakes circle tour ( [MASK] ) : the segment from the wisconsin state line near [MASK] to the m ‑ 28 junction in wakefield is part of the lake superior circle tour ( [MASK] ) , and the segment from the southern m ‑ 35 junction in [MASK] to the eastern terminus in st. ignace is part of the lake michigan circle tour ( [MASK] ) .
these two tours were created in may 1986 through a joint effort between mdot and its counterparts in wisconsin , minnesota and ontario .
the section of us 2 between iron river and crystal falls has been named the iron county heritage trail .
this pure michigan byway was designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . "
on august 26 , 2007 , mdot announced that the section of us 2 that runs concurrently with m ‑ 35 in delta county was being included in the up [MASK] coast recreational heritage trail .
= = historic bridges = =
there are six bridges along current or former sections of us 2 that mdot has added to its listing of michigan 's historic bridges ; two of these are also listed on the national register of historic places ( [MASK] ) .
a third bridge added to the [MASK] in late 2012 has not been added to mdot 's listing however .
the first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the iron river , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge .
the original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 - foot - long ( 17 m ) [MASK] arch span that was built by the mshd as trunk line bridge no.
191 .
the structure was listed on the [MASK] on december 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance .
in december 2012 , the national park service approved the listing of the upper twin falls bridge that crosses the [MASK] river northwest of iron mountain .
the structure is a single - span , pin - connected , [MASK] , through - [MASK] bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in michigan .
it was built between 1909 and 1910 because the twin falls power dam would flood an existing river crossing .
the span cost $ 5 , 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 , 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by dickinson and florence counties .
until the 1930s , the upper twin falls bridge carried us 2 across the [MASK] river .
in 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span .
the bridge closed to automobile traffic in september 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the national register of historic places began in 2012 .
in 2003 , mdot replaced the sturgeon river bridge in [MASK] township , dickinson county .
as of october 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , mdot retained it on their historic bridge list .
it was built in 1929 .
before 1983 , us 2 used a different routing through [MASK] and crossed the [MASK] river on what is nicknamed the " [MASK] bridge " .
built as a part of a [MASK] [MASK] on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface .
this produces a [MASK] effect , giving the bridge its nickname .
the [MASK] [MASK] and paper company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the [MASK] river to supply their mill .
this dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction .
instead of expensive [MASK] , a concrete tank was built [MASK] in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man - made banks higher than the natural banks .
the michigan works progress administration described the bridge as having " concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . "
the [MASK] tourism council stated : " at one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was [MASK] forced under it , " and that the bridge has been featured in ripley 's believe it or not !
.
the eight - span structure is [MASK] feet ( 90 m ) long .
the cut river bridge carries us 2 across the cut river in [MASK] township , mackinac county .
this structure was built during world war ii but completion was delayed due to war - induced steel shortages .
the span uses [MASK] short tons ( [MASK] long tons ; [MASK] t ) of structural steel to bridge the [MASK] feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its [MASK] at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river .
the cut river bridge is one of only two [MASK] deck [MASK] bridges in the state .
on either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river .
listed on the [MASK] on december 17 , 1999 , the mackinac trail – [MASK] river bridge carries h - 63 , the modern successor to us 2 , over the [MASK] river north of st. ignace .
the bridge is another [MASK] arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 .

the consortium took possession of the mill in november 1979 .
the first priority was to make the mill as [MASK] as possible .
[MASK] sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure .
the mill was surveyed and recorded .
in spring 1980 , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure .
[MASK] was erected to allow the [MASK] to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame .
a two - week work - in was held at the end of july and beginning of august 1980 .
thirty - three volunteers worked on the mill over the work - in .
two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from [MASK] of pitch pine which had previously been in a [MASK] at bury st [MASK] .
on 3 august 1980 , the [MASK] and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast - iron curb sections .
new oak [MASK] were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower .
the bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was [MASK] .
a replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired .
new oak [MASK] were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused .
one of these had previously been a whip from a common sail .
some of the [MASK] were made from pitch pine from the [MASK] [MASK] , which , following its collapse on 19 february 1977 , had been re - erected at the museum of east anglian life , [MASK] .
the [MASK] hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new [MASK] were made for some of the windows .
a [MASK] was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter .
the [MASK] on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of [MASK] was removed .
the work was financed by grants of £ 500 from the council for the preservation of rural essex , £ 250 from st [MASK] borough council , £ 200 from the [MASK] trust , and £ 200 from the suffolk mills group .
other donations and income amounted to £ 65 , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners .

in the 1981 season two separate work - ins were held , the first from 25 july to 2 august and the second from 22 august to 30 august .
a total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks .
the [MASK] were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired .
one of the main beams was found to have been attacked by death watch beetles , and over a third of the [MASK] beam was replaced with oak .
the six supports for the [MASK] frame were repaired one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above .
one post required replacement .
it had [MASK] and the floor had sunk by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the second main floor beam to fracture .
when this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed .
the new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was [MASK] .
the stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those [MASK] that were fit for reuse .
other [MASK] were made new from oak or pitch pine .
new [MASK] were laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick [MASK] boards being double - grooved with a metal tongue between them .
those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration .
the top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a [MASK] attached to the upright shaft .
during the second work - in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double - grooved boards with a metal tongue between them .
the window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued .
the top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks .
the dust floor window had a reinforced concrete [MASK] cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted .
the [MASK] , the curb segments and [MASK] [MASK] were given two coats of red lead paint .
a new [MASK] for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diameter .
a start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and [MASK] with [MASK] mortar .
after the work - in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn .
the work done in 1981 cost £ 3 , 250 .
[MASK] received were £ 2 , 000 from [MASK] [MASK] , £ 1 , [MASK] from the historic buildings council and £ 130 from st [MASK] borough council .
other donations and income received amounted to £ 70 .

the 1982 work - ins took place from 24 july to 1 august and 21 august to 29 august .
the work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the [MASK] curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows .
the cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused .
the cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 .
it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the [MASK] into position .

work in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various [MASK] and overhaul of the various parts of the [MASK] [MASK] and mechanism for controlling the patent sails .
the mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including one from the wind and [MASK] section of the society for the protection of ancient buildings .
other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 .
 40 m ) stones , including [MASK] the stone nut and replacement of three [MASK] in beech .
when the weather improved , work commenced outside .
the cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work - in commenced .
the work - ins took place over two separate weeks in july and august , with 35 people participating .
during the first work - in , the [MASK] posts and [MASK] were fitted .
the oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated [MASK] were fitted and the [MASK] was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting .
[MASK] [MASK] of oak were fitted and the [MASK] was pulled into position using a [MASK] .
the cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and [MASK] .
the rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time .
between the two work - ins , the rear [MASK] was completed and the fitting of [MASK] to the cap frame completed .
this enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the monday of the second work - in .
the boards for the cap are ½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide at the [MASK] , [MASK] towards the top .
a new neck bearing was installed under the [MASK] , not without difficulty and much [MASK] before it would fit .
when the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints .
the [MASK] was drawn into position using a rope and [MASK] , and the [MASK] steel reinforcing band [MASK] into position , producing a [MASK] structure .
the striking rod was fitted through the [MASK] and the axle for the [MASK] fitted in position on top of the [MASK] posts .
at the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates [MASK] into position .
[MASK] of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work - in .
after the work - ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift - on in october .
the weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern [MASK] paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain [MASK] , was completed in time for the lift - on .
a mini work - in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend .
final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill .
the [MASK] was removed and the [MASK] dismantled .
the 5 - ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 october 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people .
the fitting of the cap was [MASK] with beer from [MASK] [MASK] , [MASK] .
restoration work in 1983 cost £ 1 , [MASK] .
grants were received from the association of independent museums , [MASK] ' norton women 's institute , ipswich historical transport society , the national association for [MASK] children , mr d. porter and the society for the protection of ancient buildings .
further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by [MASK] [MASK] .

four work - ins were held during 1984 .
the first two were by [MASK] from eastern electricity board .
[MASK] [MASK] was chosen at the project to benefit from the young person 's development project for that year .
[MASK] [MASK] had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the suffolk preservation trust , had suggested that [MASK] [MASK] would be a good candidate for the scheme .
two separate parties spent a week each at the mill .
a [MASK] electricity supply was provided .
an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were [MASK] a thrust [MASK] which had been developed at their research facility at [MASK] heath .
the thrust [MASK] laid 25 yards ( 23 m ) of [MASK] through which the [MASK] cable was pulled into position .
the mill was then supplied with lights and [MASK] on each floor .
other work undertaken by the [MASK] involved repairing some [MASK] damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position .
a concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising [MASK] .
a french drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem .
a 21 horsepower ( 16 kw ) [MASK] & [MASK] [MASK] diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane .
after fitting it was then painted .
some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary .
off - site , the new brake wheel and [MASK] were made .
the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819 .
the original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 .
 83 m ) diameter to allow the common sails to run at their [MASK] speed .
when the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as patent sails run at a slower speed than common sails .
the great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter .
the brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original [MASK] , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 .
 18 m ) in diameter .
the opinion of professional [MASK] was sought , and it was decided that a scaled - up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments .
the remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill .
the original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat - treated malleable cast iron .
when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for [MASK] .
the [MASK] was made .
some of the small [MASK] were replaced .
the stocks were made from pitch pine and the [MASK] from douglas fir .
work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work - in began .
new beech [MASK] were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft .
the stocks and sails were made during the two work - ins held in july and august , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks .
a second - hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use .
thus two new stocks were required instead of one .
modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and [MASK] grounds , leaving two options .
traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or [MASK] stocks .
good quality pitch pine was not [MASK] in the lengths required .
douglas fir was [MASK] in such lengths but was discounted on strength and [MASK] grounds .
a douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had [MASK] after only seven years .
thus it was decided that [MASK] stocks would be made .
the 52 feet ( 15 .
 85 m ) long stocks were made from douglas fir .
all timber had been pressure treated with [MASK] and well [MASK] .
it was estimated that a [MASK] stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber .
the timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine [MASK] were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the [MASK] .
[MASK] attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber .
both stocks were made during the work - in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use .
the stocks were the first [MASK] stocks made by amateurs .
the four sails were made .
the originals being slightly different pairs .
those on the inner stock having bays of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch .
it was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch .
four 27 feet ( 8 .
 23 m ) long [MASK] were cut from a [MASK] of pitch pine obtained from a demolished [MASK] at bury st [MASK] .
the [MASK] are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end .
[MASK] bars and [MASK] were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality .
the [MASK] for the sail bars were cut .
that at the heel of the sail being at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° at each sail bar .
three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in .
the [MASK] and associated [MASK] was fitted to the mill .
at the end of the second work - in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand [MASK] .
the [MASK] itself , with the [MASK] painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards .
the [MASK] arm brake wheel was assembled around the [MASK] .
it was found that the [MASK] was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch ( 13 mm ) .
when this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 [MASK] of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true .
the [MASK] for the stocks were [MASK] from a [MASK] of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year .
other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting [MASK] and further [MASK] on the brickwork .
the four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work - in .
the stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the [MASK] and when [MASK] in position and the [MASK] had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock .
the process was repeated for the second pair of sails .
the mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work - in .
work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the [MASK] and sorting out [MASK] troubles with the [MASK] [MASK] .
the brake and brake lever were made and installed and [MASK] [MASK] for the sails were cast .
restoration work in 1984 cost £ 2 , 918 .
grants received were £ 1 , [MASK] from english heritage , £ 500 from st [MASK] borough council , other donations amounted to £ 52 .
[MASK] from open days at the mill came to £ 151 .
a boost to the funds was £ 2 , 000 from [MASK] [MASK] .
this money had been allocated to allow the moving of a [MASK] post mill buck to [MASK] .
in the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and mr [MASK] allowed the donation to remain with the [MASK] mill preservation trust .
the project received further support in local media , including the east anglian daily times , one of the work - ins being featured on [MASK] television 's about [MASK] programme .

work planned for 1985 included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails .
the external walls of the mill were [MASK] and internal walls plastered .
two work - ins were held , from 20 july to 28 july and 17 august to 26 august .
further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in 1987 .

= military history of australia =
the military history of australia spans the nation 's 220 - year modern history , from the early australian frontier wars between [MASK] and europeans to the ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in the early 21st century .
although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity , including the anzac spirit .
the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma .
as british [MASK] , the australian colonies participated in britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a [MASK] dominion , and then an independent nation , australia fought in the first world war and second world war , as well as in the wars in korea , malaya , borneo and vietnam during the cold war .
in the post - vietnam era australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the united nations and other agencies , including in the sinai , persian gulf , [MASK] , somalia , east timor and the solomon islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi - lateral forces in iraq and afghanistan .
in total , nearly 103 , 000 australians died during the course of these conflicts .
= = war and australian society = =
for most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence australian society to this day .
war and military service have been defining influences in australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an [MASK] conception of the australian experience of war and of [MASK] , known as the anzac spirit .
these ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during the first world war .
the gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity .
the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of australian strategic culture : [MASK] with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare .
indeed , australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the united states has [MASK] its security .
[MASK] , this pattern of [MASK] — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more [MASK] security concerns — has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies .
regardless , a tendency towards strategic [MASK] has also been evident , with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to [MASK] resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in [MASK] for major military challenges .
reflecting both the realist and liberal [MASK] of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious .
such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the [MASK] of notions of [MASK] sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a [MASK] of security , and the proposition that the status [MASK] in international affairs should only be changed peacefully .
likewise , [MASK] , collective security and defence self - reliance have also been important themes .
change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic [MASK] have persisted throughout its history , being the product of australian society 's democratic political tradition and [MASK] - christian anglo - european heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology .
these [MASK] are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on the edge of the asia - pacific , and the [MASK] circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power .
to be sure , during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars .
throughout these conflicts australian soldiers — known colloquially as [MASK] — have often been noted , somewhat [MASK] , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .
= = colonial era = =
= = = british forces in australia , 1788 – 1870 = = =
from 1788 until 1870 the defence of the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces .
originally marines protected the early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the new south wales corps .
the new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in 1804 .
soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the war office of the need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van [MASK] 's land .
chief of these shortcomings was the rum rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 .
as a result , in january 1810 the 73rd ( [MASK] ) regiment of foot arrived in australia .
by 1870 , 25 british infantry regiments had served in australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units .
although the primary role of the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever [MASK] .
the british army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating [MASK] , putting down convict rebellions — as occurred at bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension of european settlement .
notably british soldiers were involved in the battle at the [MASK] [MASK] in 1854 on the victorian [MASK] .
members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india , afghanistan , new zealand and the sudan .
during the early years of settlement the naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of the east indies station , based in sydney .
however , in 1859 australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a [MASK] , marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia .
the royal navy remained the primary naval force in australian waters until 1913 , when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy ; the royal navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the australian people .

the reactions of the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands .
european diseases decimated aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation .
by and large neither the british nor the [MASK] approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare .
at times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units .
not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many [MASK] served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes .
fighting between [MASK] and europeans was localised as the [MASK] did not form [MASK] capable of sustained resistance .
as a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent .
[MASK] or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century .
this warfare [MASK] the popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful settlement in australia .
faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres .
among the most famous is the battle of [MASK] in western australia in 1834 .
such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the [MASK] creek massacre in new south wales in 1838 seven europeans were hanged for their part in the killings .
however , in tasmania the so - called black war was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas .
although it began in failure for the british , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population .
it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly [MASK] by europeans on [MASK] .
although many more [MASK] died than british , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans .
aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre - existing hunting and fighting practices — using [MASK] , clubs and other primitive weapons .
unlike the indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america , on the main [MASK] failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the europeans .
although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread .
the [MASK] were never a serious military threat to european settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them .
on occasions large groups of [MASK] attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the [MASK] would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage .
this could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their [MASK] while the settlers [MASK] .
however , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the [MASK] than the europeans .
central to the success of the europeans was the use of firearms .
however , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been [MASK] .
prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often [MASK] muzzle - loading , smooth - bore , single shot [MASK] with flint - lock mechanisms .
such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) .
these deficiencies may have initially given the [MASK] an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with [MASK] or clubs .
yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage , with the six - shot [MASK] revolver , the [MASK] single shot breech - loading rifle and later the [MASK] - henry rifle , as well as rapid - fire rifles such as the winchester rifle , becoming available .
these weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of [MASK] , often proved successful .
the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast - moving , often hidden enemies .
tactics employed included night - time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks .
the conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of british settlement in australia .
beginning in new south wales with the arrival of the first europeans in may 1788 , it continued in sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s .
as the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback new south wales in the 1840s .
in tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in victoria and the southern parts of south australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s .
the south - west of western australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 .
the war in queensland began in the area around brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central queensland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern queensland from the 1860s to 1900 .
in western australia , the violence moved north with european settlement , reaching the [MASK] region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s .
in the northern territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s .
one estimate of casualties places european deaths at 2 , 500 , while at least 20 , 000 [MASK] are believed to have perished .
far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist .

other australians became scouts in the company of forest rangers .
despite experiencing [MASK] conditions the australians were not heavily involved in battle , and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties .
australians were involved in actions at [MASK] , [MASK] east , [MASK] hill , [MASK] and te [MASK] .
[MASK] than 20 were believed to have been killed in action .
the conflict was over by 1864 , and the [MASK] regiments disbanded in 1867 .
however , many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade , while many others had returned to australia .
= = = colonial military forces , 1870 – 1901 = = =
from 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence .
the colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the colonial office in london retained control of some affairs , the governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia .
to do this , they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces .
initially these were militias in support of british regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities .
the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component .
they were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline .
even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and [MASK] to be considered armies in the modern sense .
by 1885 , the forces numbered 21 , 000 men .
although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the british empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising [MASK] to serve in sudan , south africa and china .
despite a reputation of colonial [MASK] , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained .
during this period , defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts .
however , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid [MASK] of brigades of infantry .
as a consequence he called for a [MASK] of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies .
as a consequence she called for a [MASK] of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies .
edwards argued for the colonial forces to be [MASK] and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the south pacific — to replace the volunteer forces .
these views found support in the influential new south wales commandant , major general edward hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria [MASK] the proposal .
these reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies .
with the exception of western australia , the colonies also operated their own navies .
in 1856 , victoria received its own naval vessel , [MASK] victoria , and its deployment to new zealand in 1860 during the first [MASK] war marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas .
the colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid - 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo - boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts .
victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad [MASK] cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam - sail warship hms nelson on loan from the royal navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo - boats .
new south wales formed a naval brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo - boats and a [MASK] .
the queensland maritime defence force was established in 1885 , while south australia operated a single ship , hmcs protector .
tasmania had also a small torpedo corps , while western australia 's only naval defences included the fremantle naval artillery .
naval personnel from new south wales and victoria took part in the suppression of the [MASK] rebellion in china in 1900 , while hmcs protector was sent by south australia but saw no action .
the separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new commonwealth of australia .

when news of her death arrived in new south wales in february 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses .
the new south wales [MASK] consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from sydney on 3 march 1885 .
the contingent arrived in [MASK] on 29 march and were attached to a brigade that consisted of scots , [MASK] and [MASK] guards .
they subsequently marched for [MASK] in a large " square " formation made up of 10 , 000 men .
reaching the village , they burned [MASK] and returned to [MASK] : three australians were wounded in minor fighting .
most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards [MASK] , on the nile .
the australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered .
they [MASK] on a reconnaissance to [MASK] on 6 may and were heavily involved in a [MASK] during which more than 100 arabs were killed or captured .
on 15 may , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous march .
meanwhile , the artillery were posted at [MASK] and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at [MASK] .
eventually the british government decided that the campaign in sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in [MASK] .
the new south wales [MASK] sailed for home on 17 may , arriving in sydney on 19 june 1885 .
approximately 770 australians served in sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign .
= = = second boer war , 1899 – 1902 = = =
british encroachment into areas of south africa already settled by the [MASK] [MASK] and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the second boer war in 1899 .
pre - [MASK] the deployment of british forces , the [MASK] [MASK] of the orange free state and the [MASK] republic under president paul [MASK] declared war on 11 october 1899 , striking deep into the british territories of natal and the cape colony .
after the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined australian force were subsequently set aside by the british war office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate [MASK] to serve with british formations , with two squadrons each of 125 men from new south wales and victoria , and one each from the other colonies .
the first troops arrived three weeks later , with the new south wales [MASK] — who had been training in england before the war , [MASK] diverted to south africa .
on 22 november , the [MASK] came under fire for the first time near [MASK] , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them .
following a series of minor victories , the british suffered a major setback during black week between 10 – 17 december 1899 , although no australian units were involved .
the first [MASK] of infantry from victoria , south australia , western australia , and tasmania arrived in cape town on 26 november and were designated the australian regiment under the command of colonel john charles [MASK] .
with a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry .
further units from queensland and new south wales arrived in december and were soon committed to the front .
the first casualties occurred soon after at [MASK] on 1 january 1900 , after 250 queensland mounted infantry and a column of canadians , british and artillery attacked a boer [MASK] at [MASK] .
[MASK] david [MASK] and victor jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the boer forward [MASK] .
regardless , the [MASK] were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner .
five hundred [MASK] and the new south wales [MASK] subsequently took part in the siege of [MASK] in february 1900 .
despite serious set - backs at [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] , and [MASK] [MASK] in january — and with [MASK] still under siege — the british mounted a five division counter - invasion of the orange free state in february .
the attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by lieutenant general john french with the new south wales [MASK] , queensland mounted infantry and new south wales army medical corps attached .
first , [MASK] was relieved following the battles of [MASK] river and [MASK] , and the retreating [MASK] defeated at [MASK] , with the new south wales mounted rifles locating the boer general , [MASK] [MASK] .
the british entered [MASK] on 13 march 1900 , while [MASK] was relieved .
disease began to take its toll and scores of men died .
still the advance continued , with the drive to [MASK] in may including more than 3 , 000 australians .
johannesburg fell on 30 may , and the [MASK] withdrew from [MASK] on 3 june .
the new south wales mounted rifles and western australians saw action again at diamond hill on 12 june .
[MASK] was relieved on 17 may .
following the defeat of the [MASK] republics still the [MASK] held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines of supply .
this new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the australian colonies and the raising of the [MASK] 's [MASK] , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse - riding and shooting skills , but little military experience .
after federation in 1901 , eight australian commonwealth horse battalions of the newly created australian army were also sent to south africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended .
some australians later joined local south african irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge .
these soldiers were part of the british army , and were subject to british military discipline .
such units included the [MASK] [MASK] which gained notoriety as the unit in which harry " [MASK] " [MASK] and peter [MASK] served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes .
with the guerrillas requiring supplies , [MASK] de la rey lead a force of 3 , 000 [MASK] against [MASK] , on the [MASK] river in western [MASK] .
the post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 australians and 200 [MASK] .
the attack began on 4 august 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties .
during the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire .
a relief force was stopped by the [MASK] , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved .
the siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 , 800 shells were fired into the post .
after calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the [MASK] eventually retired .
the siege of [MASK] river was one of the major achievements of the australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 august .
in response the british adopted counter - insurgency tactics , including a [MASK] earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for boer women and children , and a system of [MASK] and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications .
such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the british , however they soon yielded results .
by mid - 1901 , the bulk of the fighting was over , and british mounted units would ride at night to attack boer [MASK] or [MASK] , overwhelming them with superior numbers .
[MASK] of warfare in last months of 1901 , the new south wales mounted rifles travelled 1 , [MASK] miles ( 2 , [MASK] km ) and were involved in 13 [MASK] , killing 27 [MASK] , wounding 15 , and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded .
other notable australian actions included [MASK] , pink hill , [MASK] and [MASK] .
australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war .
on 12 june 1901 , the 5th victorian mounted rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at [MASK] , near [MASK] after poor security allowed a force of 150 [MASK] to surprise them .
on 30 october 1901 , [MASK] of the scottish horse regiment also suffered heavy casualties at gun hill , although 60 [MASK] were also killed in the engagement .
meanwhile , at [MASK] on 4 january 1902 , the 5th queensland imperial [MASK] lost 13 killed and 17 wounded .
ultimately the [MASK] were defeated , and the war ended on 31 may 1902 .
in all 16 , 175 australians served in south africa , and perhaps another 10 , 000 enlisted as individuals in imperial units ; casualties included 251 killed in action , 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action , while a further 735 were wounded .
six australians were awarded the victoria cross .
= = = [MASK] rebellion , 1900 – 01 = = =
the [MASK] rebellion in china began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many european powers , the united states , and japan — soon sent forces as part of the china field force to protect their interests .
in june , the british government sought permission from the australian colonies to dispatch ships from the australian squadron to china .
the colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in south africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower .
the force dispatched was a modest one , with britain accepting 200 men from victoria , 260 from new south wales and the south australian ship hmcs protector , under the command of captain william [MASK] .
most of these forces were made up of naval brigade [MASK] , who had been trained in both ship handling and [MASK] to fulfil their coastal defence role .
amongst the naval contingent from new south wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at victoria barracks , sydney who originally enlisted for the second boer war .
the soldiers were keen to go to china but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the new south wales naval brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks .
the army and navy compromised and titled the contingent the [MASK] marine light infantry .
the [MASK] from new south wales and victoria sailed for china on 8 august 1900 .
arriving in [MASK] , the australians provided 300 men to an 8 , 000 - strong multinational force tasked with capturing the chinese forts at [MASK] tang , which dominated a key railway .
they arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at [MASK] - [MASK] fu , where the chinese government was believed to have found [MASK] after [MASK] was captured by western forces .
the [MASK] joined a force of 7 , 500 men on a ten - day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered .
the [MASK] then garrisoned [MASK] and the new south wales contingent undertook garrison duties in [MASK] .
hmcs protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and [MASK] duties in the gulf of [MASK] , before departing in november .
the naval brigades remained during the winter , [MASK] performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as [MASK] and fire - fighters .
they left china in march 1901 , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order .
six australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action .
= = australian military forces at federation , 1901 = =
the commonwealth of australia came into existence on 1 january 1901 as a result of the federation of the australian colonies .
under the constitution of australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government .
the co - ordination of australia - wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial german interest in the pacific ocean was one of driving forces behind [MASK] , and the department of defence immediately came into being as a result , while the commonwealth military forces ( early forerunner of the australian army ) and commonwealth naval force were also soon established .
the australian commonwealth military forces came into being on 1 march 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in south africa — became part of the new force .
28 , [MASK] colonial soldiers , including 1 , 457 professional soldiers , 18 , 603 paid militia and 8 , [MASK] unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred .
the individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial acts until the defence act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation .
this act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside australia .
however , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the citizen military forces ( [MASK] ) .
major general sir edward hutton — a former commander of the new south wales military forces — subsequently became the first commander of the commonwealth military forces on 26 december and set to work [MASK] an integrated structure for the new army .
in 1911 , following a report by lord [MASK] the royal military college , [MASK] was established , as was a system of universal national service .
prior to federation each self - governing colony had operated its own naval force .
these navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to [MASK] the cost of a british naval squadron in their waters for decades .
the colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 march 1901 , when the commonwealth naval force was created .
this new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in australian naval policy .
in 1907 prime minister alfred deakin and [MASK] , while attending the imperial conference in london , sought the british government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an australian navy .
the admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested [MASK] that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient .
deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the american great white fleet to visit australia .
this visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 - ton river - class destroyers .
the surge in german naval construction prompted the admiralty to change their position however and the royal australian navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the commonwealth naval force .
on 4 october 1913 , the new fleet steamed through sydney heads , consisting of the battlecruiser [MASK] australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction .
and as a consequence the navy entered the first world war as a formidable force .
the australian flying corps ( afc ) was established as part of the commonwealth military forces in 1912 , prior to the formation of the australian military forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the royal australian air force , making it the second oldest air force in the world .
regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments .

= = = [MASK] of hostilities = = =
when britain declared war on germany at the start of the first world war , the australian government rapidly followed suit , with prime minister joseph cook declaring on 5 august 1914 that " ... when the empire is at war , so also is australia " and reflecting the sentiment of many australians that any declaration of war by britain automatically included australia .
this was itself in part due to the large number of british - born citizens and first generation anglo - australians that made up the australian population at the time .
indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the australian forces had been born in britain .
as the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the defence act 1903 , an all - volunteer expeditionary force known as the australian imperial force ( aif ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 august 1914 .
the government pledged 20 , 000 men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units .
[MASK] and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under [MASK] plans drawn up in 1912 .
the first commander was major general william bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st division .
throughout the course of the conflict australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed .

following the outbreak of war australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of germany 's pacific colonies .
the australian naval and military expeditionary force ( [MASK] & [MASK] ) , a 2000 - man volunteer force — separate from the aif — and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval [MASK] and ex - sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of william holmes .
the objectives of the force were the wireless stations on [MASK] , and those at yap in the caroline islands , and at rabaul in german new guinea .
the force reached rabaul on 11 september 1914 and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the german and native defenders during fighting at [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] .
german new guinea surrendered on 17 september 1914 .
australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine [MASK] with all 35 men aboard .
= = = gallipoli = = =
the aif departed by ship in a single convoy from albany on 1 november 1914 .
during the journey one of the convoy 's naval escorts — [MASK] sydney — engaged and destroyed the german cruiser sms [MASK] at the battle of [MASK] on 8 november , in the first ship - to - ship action involving the royal australian navy .
although originally bound for england to undergo further training and then for employment on the western front , the australians were instead sent to british - controlled egypt to pre - [MASK] any turkish attack against the strategically important suez canal , and with a view to opening another front against the central powers .
[MASK] to knock turkey out of the war the british then decided to stage an amphibious [MASK] at gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the australians were included amongst the british , indian and french forces committed to the campaign .
the combined australian and new zealand army corps ( anzac ) — commanded by british general william birdwood — subsequently landed at anzac cove on the gallipoli peninsula on 25 april 1915 .
although promising to transform the war if successful , the gallipoli campaign was ill - conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives .
australian casualties totalled 26 , 111 , including 8 , 141 killed .
for australians and new zealanders the gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity .
today , the date of the initial landings , 25 april , is known as anzac day in australia and new zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original [MASK] , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war .

after the withdrawal from gallipoli the australians returned to egypt and the aif underwent a major expansion .
in 1916 the infantry began to move to france while the cavalry units remained in the middle east to fight the turks .
australian troops of the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division saw action in all the major battles of the sinai and palestine campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the turkish troops that were threatening british control of egypt .
the australian 's first saw combat during the [MASK] uprising in the [MASK] desert and the nile valley , during which the combined british forces successfully put down the primitive pro - turkish islamic sect with heavy casualties .
the anzac mounted division subsequently saw considerable action in the battle of romani against the turkish between 3 – 5 august 1916 , with the turks eventually pushed back .
following this victory the british forces went on the offensive in the sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the suez canal .
rafa was captured on 9 january 1917 , while the last of the small turkish garrisons in the sinai were eliminated in february .
the advance entered palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture gaza on 26 march 1917 , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 april .
a third assault occurred between 31 october and 7 november and this time both the anzac mounted division and the australian mounted division took part .
the battle was a complete success for the british , over - running the gaza - beersheba line and capturing 12 , 000 turkish soldiers .
the critical moment was the capture of beersheba on the first day , after the australian 4th light horse brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 .
 4 km ) .
the turkish trenches were overrun , with the australians capturing the wells at [MASK] and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded .
later , australian troops assisted in pushing the turkish forces out of palestine and took part in actions at [MASK] ridge , jerusalem and the [MASK] .
the turkish government surrendered on 30 october 1918 .
units of the light horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process .
meanwhile , the afc had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the [MASK] .
[MASK] just a single aircraft to german new guinea in 1914 , the first operational flight did not occur until 27 may 1915 however , when the [MASK] half flight was called upon to assist in protecting british oil interests in iraq .
the afc was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in egypt , palestine and on the western front , where they performed well .
= = = western front = = =
five infantry divisions of the aif saw action in france and belgium , leaving egypt in march 1916 .
i anzac corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of [MASK] on 7 april 1916 and for the next two and a half years the aif participated in most of the major battles on the western front , earning a formidable reputation .
although spared from the disastrous first day of the battle of the somme , within weeks four australian divisions had been committed .
the 5th division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the battle of [MASK] on 19 july 1916 , suffering 5 , 533 casualties in a single day .
the 1st division entered the line on 23 july , assaulting [MASK] , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd division on 27 july , they had suffered 5 , 286 casualties .
mouquet farm was attacked in august , with casualties totalling 6 , 300 men .
by the time the aif was withdrawn from the somme to re - organise , they had suffered 23 , 000 casualties in just 45 days .
in march 1917 , the 2nd and 5th divisions pursued the germans back to the hindenburg line , capturing the town of [MASK] .
on 11 april , the 4th division assaulted the hindenburg line in the disastrous first battle of [MASK] , losing over 3 , 000 casualties and 1 , 170 captured .
on 15 april , the 1st and 2nd divisions were counter - attacked near [MASK] and were forced to abandon the town , before [MASK] it again .
the 2nd division then took part in the second battle of [MASK] , beginning on 3 may , and succeeded in taking sections of the hindenburg line and holding them until relieved by the 1st division .
finally , on 7 may the 5th division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid - may .
combined these efforts cost 7 , [MASK] australian casualties .
on 7 june 1917 , the ii anzac corps — along with two british corps — launched an operation in flanders to eliminate a salient south of ypres .
the attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( 454 , 545 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the [MASK] ridge , destroying the german trenches .
the advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong german counterattacks the next day , it succeeded .
australian casualties during the battle of [MASK] included nearly 6 , 800 men .
i anzac corps then took part in the third battle of ypres in belgium as part of the campaign to capture the [MASK] plateau , between september and november 1917 .
individual actions took place at [MASK] road , [MASK] wood , [MASK] , [MASK] and passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the australians suffered 38 , 000 casualties .
on 21 march 1918 the german army launched its spring offensive in a last - [MASK] effort to win the war , [MASK] sixty - three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km ) front .
as the allies fell back the 3rd and 4th divisions were rushed south to amiens on the somme .
the offensive lasted for the next five months and all five aif divisions in france were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide .
by late may the germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of paris .
during this time the australians fought at [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] - [MASK] , [MASK] wood , [MASK] , and hamel .
at hamel the commander of the australian corps , lieutenant general john monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in an attack for the first time .
the german offensive ground to a halt in mid - july and a brief lull followed , during which the australians undertook a series of raids , known as [MASK] [MASK] .
the allies soon launched their own offensive — the hundred days offensive — ultimately ending the war .
beginning on 8 august 1918 the offensive included four australian divisions striking at amiens .
using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the " black day " of the german army .
the offensive continued for four months , and during second battle of the somme the australian corps fought actions at [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] , and mont st quentin , before their final engagement of the war on 5 october 1918 at [MASK] .
the aif was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 november 1918 .
in all [MASK] , [MASK] australians enlisted in the aif during the war and 333 , 000 served overseas .
61 , 508 were killed and another 155 , 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) .
the financial cost to the australian government was calculated at £ [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] .
two [MASK] on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting .
consequently , australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war .
the war had a profound effect on australian society in other ways also .
indeed , for many australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of australian character and [MASK] that exist today have their origins in the war .
64 australians were awarded the victoria cross during the first world war .

the russian civil war began after the russian provisional government collapsed and the [MASK] party assumed power in october 1917 .
following the end of the first world war , the western powers — including britain — intervened , giving half - hearted support to the pro - [MASK] , anti - [MASK] white russian forces .
although the australian government refused to commit forces , many australians serving with the british army became involved in the fighting .
a small number served as advisors to white russian units with the north russian expeditionary force ( [MASK] ) .
[MASK] repatriation in england , about 150 australians subsequently enlisted in the british north russia relief force ( [MASK] ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed .
the royal australian navy destroyer [MASK] swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the black sea in late 1918 .
other australians served as advisers with the british military mission to the white russian general , anton [MASK] in south russia , while several more advised admiral [MASK] [MASK] in siberia .
later , they also served in mesopotamia as part of [MASK] and the [MASK] mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing turkish access to the middle east and india , and did little fighting .
although the motivations of those australian 's that volunteered to fight in russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political .
regardless , they confirmed a reputation for [MASK] and courage , winning the only two victoria crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers .
yet australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war .
total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in mesopotamia .

in october 1927 , [MASK] adelaide was called to the british solomon islands [MASK] as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by [MASK] natives at [MASK] on the island of [MASK] on 3 october , known as the [MASK] massacre .
arriving at [MASK] on 14 october , the ship proceeded to [MASK] to protect the landing of three platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the [MASK] .
the ship 's personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support .
adelaide returned to australia on 23 november .
= = = spanish civil war , 1936 – 39 = = =
a small number of australian volunteers fought on both sides of the spanish civil war , although they predominantly supported the spanish republic through the international brigades .
the australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other [MASK] , such as the british battalion and the lincoln battalion , rather than forming their own units .
most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were spanish - born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin .
at least 66 australians volunteered , with only one — [MASK] bull , a conservative [MASK] who was later killed serving in the raf during the second world war — known to have fought for general francisco franco 's nationalist forces .
while a celebrated cause for the australian left — particularly the communist party of australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality .
australian opposition to the republican cause was [MASK] by [MASK] [MASK] on an anti - communist basis , rather than a pro - nationalist basis .
[MASK] , although individual right wing australians may have served with the nationalist rebels , they received no public support .
service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of australians travelling to spain to enlist , no action was taken .
consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the [MASK] and services league of australia ( [MASK] ) .
although the number of australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed .

australia entered the second world war on 3 september 1939 .
at the time of the declaration of war against germany the australian military was small and [MASK] for war .
[MASK] for a second australian imperial force ( 2nd aif ) began in mid - september .
while there was no rush of volunteers like the first world war , a high proportion of australian men of military age had enlisted by mid - 1940 .
four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were dispatched to the middle east .
the raaf 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the commonwealth air forces through the empire air training scheme ( [MASK] ) , through which almost 28 , 000 australians were trained during the war .
the australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against italian forces in the mediterranean and north africa .
during 1940 the light cruiser [MASK] sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the " [MASK] iron flotilla " by nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the british mediterranean fleet , and sank several italian warships .
the army first saw action in january 1941 , when the 6th division formed part of the commonwealth forces during operation [MASK] .
the division assaulted and captured [MASK] on 5 january and [MASK] on 22 january , with tens of thousands of italian troops surrendering at both towns .
the 6th division took part in the pursuit of the italian army and captured [MASK] on 4 february .
in late february it was withdrawn for service in greece , and was replaced by the 9th division .
the australian forces in the mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 .
during april , the 6th division , other elements of i corps and several australian warships formed part of the allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend greece from german invasion during the battle of greece .
at the end of this campaign , the 6th division was evacuated to egypt and crete .
the force at crete subsequently fought in the battle of crete during may , which also ended in defeat for the allies .
over 5 , 000 australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat .
the germans and italians also went on the offensive in north africa at the end of march and drove the commonwealth force there back to near the border with egypt .
the 9th division and a brigade of the 7th division were besieged at [MASK] ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by british units in october .
during june , the main body of the 7th division , a brigade of the 6th division and the i corps headquarters took part in the syria - lebanon campaign against the [MASK] french .
resistance was stronger than expected ; australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the french [MASK] in early july .
the majority of australian units in the mediterranean returned to australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the pacific war .
the 9th division was the largest unit to remain in the middle east , and played a key role in the first battle of el [MASK] during june and the second battle of el [MASK] in october .
the division returned to australia in early 1943 , but several raaf squadrons and [MASK] warships took part in the subsequent tunisia campaign and the italian campaign from 1943 until the end of the war .
the raaf 's role in the strategic air offensive in europe formed australia 's main contribution to the defeat of germany .
approximately 13 , 000 australian airmen served in dozens of british and five australian squadrons in raf [MASK] command between 1940 and the end of the war .
australians took part in all of [MASK] command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on german cities and targets in france .
australian aircrew in [MASK] command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the australian military during the second world war and sustained almost 20 percent of all australian deaths in combat ; 3 , 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner .
australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of western europe during 1944 and 1945 and two raaf maritime patrol squadrons served in the battle of the atlantic .
= = = asia and the pacific = = =
from the 1920s australia 's defence thinking was dominated by british imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the " singapore strategy " .
this strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at singapore from which a large british fleet would respond to japanese aggression in the region .
to this end , a high proportion of australian forces in asia were concentrated in malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from japan increased .
however , as a result of the emphasis on co - operation with britain , relatively few australian military units had been retained in australia and the asia - pacific region .
measures were taken to improve australia 's defences as war with japan [MASK] in 1941 , but these proved inadequate .
in december 1941 , the australian army in the pacific comprised the 8th division , most of which was stationed in malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in australia .
the raaf was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the [MASK] had three cruisers and two destroyers in australian waters .
the australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the pacific war .
the 8th division and raaf squadrons in malaya formed a part of the british commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller japanese invasion force which landed on 7 december .
the british commonwealth force withdrew to singapore at the end of january , but was forced to surrender on 15 february after the japanese captured much of the island .
smaller australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at rabaul , and in ambon , timor , and java .
the australian town of darwin was heavily bombed by the japanese on 19 february , to prevent it from being used as an allied base .
over 22 , 000 australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in japanese captivity .
the prisoners were subjected to [MASK] , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards .
as a result , 8 , 296 australian prisoners died in captivity .
the rapid allied defeat in the pacific caused many australians to fear that the japanese would invade the australian mainland .
while elements of the imperial japanese navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the japanese imperial general headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating australia from the united states by capturing new guinea , the solomon islands , fiji , samoa , and new caledonia .
this fact was not known by the allies at the time , and the australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion .
large numbers of united states army and army air forces units arrived in australia in early 1942 , and the australian military was placed under the overall command of general douglas macarthur in march .
australians played a central role in the new guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 .
after an attempt to land troops at port moresby was defeated in the battle of the coral sea , the japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the owen stanley ranges and milne bay .
australian army units defeated these offensives in the [MASK] track campaign and battle of milne bay with the support of the raaf and usaaf .
australian and us army units subsequently assaulted and captured the japanese bases on the north coast of papua in the hard - fought battle of [MASK] - [MASK] .
the australian army also defeated a japanese attempt to capture the town of [MASK] in january 1943 and went onto the offensive in the [MASK] - lae campaign in april .
in late 1943 , the 7th and 9th divisions played an important role in operation [MASK] , when they landed to the east and west of lae and secured the [MASK] peninsula during the [MASK] peninsula campaign and [MASK] range campaign .
the australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 .
japanese submarines operated off australia from may to august 1942 and january to june 1943 .
these attacks sought to cut the allied supply lines between australia and the us and australia and new guinea , but were unsuccessful .
japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against allied bases in northern australia which were being used to mount the north western area campaign against japanese positions in the netherlands east indies ( [MASK] ) .
australia 's role in the pacific war declined from 1944 .
the increasing size of the us forces in the pacific rendered the australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production .
nevertheless , the government wanted the australian military to remain active , and agreed to macarthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns .
in late 1944 , australian troops and raaf squadrons replaced us garrisons in eastern new guinea , new britain , and [MASK] , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining japanese forces there .
in may 1945 , i corps , the australian first tactical air force and usaaf and usn units began the borneo campaign , which continued until the end of the war .
these campaigns contributed little to japan 's defeat and remain controversial .
following japan 's surrender on 15 august 1945 australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of borneo and the eastern netherlands east indies until british and dutch colonial rule was restored .
australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of japanese personnel .
[MASK] , 000 australians enlisted during the war , while [MASK] , 000 served overseas .
casualties included 39 , 767 killed and another 66 , [MASK] were wounded .
20 victoria crosses were awarded to australians .

the [MASK] of the australian military following the end of the second world war was completed in 1947 .
plans for post - war defence arrangements were [MASK] on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force .
it was envisioned that the royal australian navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved .
the royal australian air force would have a strength of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the citizen air force .
meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the australian army would include a permanent field force of 19 , 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part - time force of 50 , 000 men in the citizen military forces .
the australian regular army was subsequently formed on 30 september 1947 , while the [MASK] was re - raised on 1 july 1948 .
= = = occupation of japan , 1946 – 52 = = =
in the immediate post - war period australia contributed significant forces to the allied occupation of japan as part of the british commonwealth occupation force ( [MASK] ) , which included forces from australia , britain , india and new zealand .
at its height in 1946 the australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 , 500 personnel .
the australian army component initially consisted of the 34th brigade which arrived in japan in february 1946 and was based in [MASK] prefecture .
the three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the royal australian regiment in 1949 , and the 34th brigade became the 1st brigade when it returned to australia in december 1948 , forming the basis of the post - war regular army .
from that time the australian army contribution to the occupation of japan was reduced to a single under - strength battalion .
australian forces remained until september 1951 when the [MASK] ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the korean [MASK] following the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 .
the raaf component consisted of nos.
76 , 77 and 82 squadrons as part of no.
81 wing raaf flying p - 51 mustangs , initially based at [MASK] from march 1946 , before transferring to [MASK] in 1948 .
however , by 1950 only no.

a total of ten [MASK] warships served in japan during this period , including [MASK] ships australia , hobart , shropshire , [MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] , murchison , [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] , while [MASK] ships [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] also provided support .

during the early years of the cold war , australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the western world and eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the united nations , or a coalition led by either the united states or britain .
the middle east was considered the most likely area of operations for australian forces , where they would most likely operate with british forces .
early commitments included the involvement of raaf aircrew during the berlin [MASK] in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of no.
78 wing raaf to malta in the mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 .

on 25 june 1950 , the north korean army ( kpa ) crossed the border into south korea and advanced for the capital seoul , which fell in less than a week .
north korean forces continued toward the port of pusan and two days later the united states offered its assistance to south korea .
in response the united nations security council requested members to assist in [MASK] the north korean attack .
australia initially contributed p - 51 mustang fighter - bomber aircraft from no.
77 squadron raaf and infantry from the 3rd battalion , royal australian regiment ( 3 rar ) , both of which were stationed in japan as part of the [MASK] .
in addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the british commonwealth forces korea .
the [MASK] frigate [MASK] [MASK] , and the destroyer [MASK] [MASK] , were also committed .
later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard [MASK] sydney was added to the force .
by the time 3 rar arrived in pusan on 28 september , the north koreans were in retreat following the [MASK] landings .
as a part of the invasion force under the un supreme commander , general douglas macarthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at battle of [MASK] near [MASK] on 22 october , before advancing towards the [MASK] river .
further successful actions followed at [MASK] on 25 – 26 october 1950 and at [MASK] on 29 october 1950 .
north korean casualties were heavy , while australian losses included their commanding officer , lieutenant colonel charles green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 november .

meanwhile , during the last weeks of october the chinese had moved 18 divisions of the people 's volunteer army across the [MASK] river to reinforce the remnants of the kpa .
[MASK] by us and south korean intelligence , the 13th army group crossed the border on 16 october and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into north korea , and were reinforced in early november by 12 divisions from the 9th army group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 , 000 men .
3 rar fought its first action against the chinese at [MASK] on 5 november .
the fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake .
following the chinese intervention , the un forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 rar was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel .
a series of battles followed at [MASK] on 1 – 4 january 1951 , as the british and australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the south korean capital .
further fighting occurred at [MASK] - [MASK] on 14 – 17 february 1951 following another chinese advance , and later at [MASK] - san between 7 – 12 march 1951 as the un resumed the offensive .
australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the battle of [MASK] .
on 22 april , chinese forces attacked the [MASK] valley and forced the south korean defenders to withdraw .
australian and canadian troops were ordered to halt this chinese advance .
after a night of fighting the australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded .
in july 1951 , the australian battalion became part of the combined canadian , british , australian , new zealand , and indian 1st commonwealth division .
the second major battle took place during operation commando and occurred after the chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the imjin river .
the 1st commonwealth division counter - attacked on 3 october , capturing a number of objectives including hill 355 and hill 317 during the battle of maryang san ; after five days the chinese retreated .
australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded .
the [MASK] then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the first world war , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and [MASK] forts behind barbed wire defences .
from 1951 until the end of the war , 3 rar held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the imjin river .
across from them were heavily fortified chinese positions .
in march 1952 , australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 rar .
this battalion remained in korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 rar in april 1953 .
the australians fought their last battle during 24 – 26 july 1953 , with 2 rar holding off a [MASK] chinese attack along the [MASK] river and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded .

1 squadron and a flight of dakotas from no.
38 squadron arrived in singapore to form part of the british commonwealth far east air force ( [MASK] ) .
the dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as [MASK] and [MASK] drops , while the lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the communist terrorist ( ct ) jungle bases .
the raaf were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as operation [MASK] , five lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the raf and ground troops .
the [MASK] were withdrawn in 1958 , and were replaced by canberra bombers from no.

based at raaf base [MASK] they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas .
australian ground forces were deployed to malaya in october 1955 as part of the far east strategic reserve .
in january 1956 , the first australian ground forces were deployed on malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd battalion , royal australian regiment ( 2 rar ) .
2 rar mainly participated in " [MASK] up " operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the ct jungle bases , as part of 28th british commonwealth brigade .
contact with the enemy was [MASK] and results small , achieving relatively few kills .
2 rar left malaysia october 1957 to be replaced by 3 rar .
3 rar underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving [MASK] insurgents back into the jungle of [MASK] and [MASK] .
the new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes .
again contact was limited , although 3 rar had more success than its predecessor .
by late 1959 , operations against the [MASK] were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the thailand border .
3 rar left malaysia october 1959 and was replaced by 1 rar .
though patrolling the border 1 rar did not make contact with the insurgents , and in october 1960 it was replaced by 2 rar , which stayed in malaysia until august 1963 .
the malayan emergency officially ended on 31 july 1960 .
australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air - field construction squadron .
the royal australian navy also served in malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 .
the emergency was the longest continued commitment in australian military history ; 7 , 000 australians served and 51 died in malaya — although only 15 were on operations — and another 27 were wounded .

the strength of the australian army would be increased by 50 % over three years from 22 , 000 to 33 , 000 ; providing a full three - brigade division with nine battalions .

in 1964 , conscription or national service was re - introduced under the national service act , for selected 20 - year - olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full - time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) .
in 1961 , three charles f. adams - class destroyers were purchased from the united states to replace the ageing q - class destroyers .
traditionally , the [MASK] had purchased designs based on those of the royal navy and the purchase of american destroyers was significant .
[MASK] perth and [MASK] hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by [MASK] brisbane in 1967 .
other projects included the construction of six river - class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier [MASK] melbourne to an anti - submarine role , the acquisition of ten wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six oberon - class submarines .
the raaf took delivery of their first [MASK] fighters in 1967 , [MASK] no.

77 squadrons with them .
the service also received american f - 111 strike aircraft , c - 130 [MASK] transports , p - 3 orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and italian [MASK] trainers .
= = = indonesia - malaysia [MASK] , 1962 – 66 = = =
the indonesia - malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the british commonwealth and indonesia over the creation of the federation of malaysia , with the commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state .
the war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of borneo , although a number of indonesian [MASK] and airborne incursions onto the malay peninsula did occur .
as part of australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of malaysia , army , naval and [MASK] units were based there as part of the far east strategic reserve .
regardless the australian government was wary of involvement in a war with indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the malayan peninsula only .
on two occasions australian troops from 3 rar were used to help [MASK] up [MASK] from [MASK] and airborne incursions at [MASK] and [MASK] , in september and october 1964 .
following these raids the government conceded to british and malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to borneo .
during the early phases , british and malaysian troops had attempted only to control the malaysian / indonesian border , and to protect population centres .
however , by the time the australian battalion deployed the british had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into [MASK] to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the [MASK] to remain on the defensive , under the [MASK] operation [MASK] .
the fighting took place in mountainous , jungle - clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross - border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions .
3 rar deployed to borneo in march 1965 , and served in [MASK] until the end of july , operating on both sides of the border .
the battalion had four major contacts with indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including at sungei [MASK] , [MASK] and [MASK] during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the [MASK] — as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents .
4 rar served a less - eventful tour between april and august 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully [MASK] with the [MASK] on a number of occasions .
a squadron of the special air service regiment ( [MASK] ) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross - border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the [MASK] , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance .
other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of [MASK] ships were involved in shelling indonesian positions in borneo and in [MASK] [MASK] in the singapore strait .
the raaf played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated .
operations in borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross - border missions only occurred in 1996 .
following a military coup in indonesia in early 1966 which brought general [MASK] to power , a peace treaty was signed in august 1966 which ended the conflict .
3 , 500 australians served during [MASK] ; casualties included 16 dead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded .
= = = vietnam war , 1962 – 73 = = =
australia 's involvement in the vietnam war was driven largely by the rise of communism in southeast asia after the second world war , and the fear of its spread which developed in australia during the 1950s and early 1960s .
as a consequence , australia supported south vietnam throughout the early 1960s .
in 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the south vietnamese government , [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] , asked for assistance from the us and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist north vietnam .
australia offered 30 military advisors from the australian army training team vietnam , which became known simply as " the team " .
they arrived in july and august 1962 , beginning australia 's involvement in the war .
later in august 1964 , the raaf sent a flight of [MASK] transport aircraft to the port city of [MASK] [MASK] .
however , with the security situation in south vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the us increased its involvement to 200 , 000 combat troops by early 1965 .
australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 rar to serve with the us [MASK] airborne brigade in [MASK] [MASK] province in june 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including gang [MASK] , operation [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .
in march 1966 , the australian government announced the deployment of a brigade - sized unit — the 1st australian task force ( 1 [MASK] ) — to replace 1 rar .
included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial national service scheme .
[MASK] of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at [MASK] [MASK] , in [MASK] tuy province .
included were the iroquois helicopters of no.
9 squadron raaf .
at the battle of long tan on 18 august 1966 , d company , 6 rar with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a viet cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself .
18 australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield .
the battle allowed the australians to gain dominance over [MASK] tuy province and 1 [MASK] was not fundamentally challenged again .
regardless , during february 1967 the australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the bulk during operation [MASK] .
yet with the [MASK] tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield .
1 [MASK] was subsequently deployed [MASK] infiltration routes leading to saigon to [MASK] communist movement against the capital as part of operation [MASK] during the 1968 [MASK] offensive and later during the battle of coral – [MASK] in may and june 1968 .
at fire support [MASK] coral and [MASK] the australians had clashed with regular north vietnamese army and viet cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war .
during 26 days of fighting australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured .
other significant australian actions included binh ba in june 1969 , [MASK] [MASK] in late - december 1968 and early 1969 and long [MASK] in june 1971 .
at the height of the australian commitment , 1 [MASK] numbered 8 , 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support .
a third raaf unit , no.
2 squadron raaf , flying canberra bombers , was sent in 1967 , and four [MASK] destroyers joined us patrols in the waters off north vietnam .
the australian withdrawal effectively commenced in november 1970 .
as a consequence of the overall allied strategy of vietnamization and with the australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 rar was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty .
1 [MASK] was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining .
australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 [MASK] ceased operations in october .
meanwhile , the advisors remained to train south vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 december 1972 by the newly elected labor government of [MASK] [MASK] .
the last australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 .
the vietnam war was australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti - war movement developed .
more than 50 , 000 australians served in vietnam ; [MASK] were killed and 2 , 398 were wounded .
four were awarded the victoria cross .

= = = creation of the australian defence force , 1976 = = =
although the importance of ' joint ' warfare had been highlighted during second world war when australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co - ordination between the services in the post - war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine .
the need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the australian military 's experiences in the vietnam war .
in 1973 , the secretary of the department of defence , arthur [MASK] , submitted a report to the government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of chief of the defence force staff .
the [MASK] labor government subsequently amalgamated the five defence [MASK] ( defence , navy , army , air force , and supply ) into a single department of defence in 1973 , while conscription under the national service scheme was abolished .
on 1 january 1976 , the three branches of the australian military were brought together as a unified , all - volunteer , professional force known as the australian defence force ( [MASK] ) .
today , the [MASK] is headquartered at russell [MASK] in canberra and is divided into air , land , maritime and special operations [MASK] .
in addition , northern command is based in darwin , and is responsible for operations in northern australia .
= = = defence of australia , 1980s and 1990s = = =
until the 1970s , australia 's military strategy centred on the concept of forward defence , in which the role of australian military and naval forces were to co - operate with allied forces to counter threats in australia 's region .
following the adoption of the guam doctrine by the united states in 1969 , and the british withdrawal ' east of suez ' in the early 1970s , australia developed a defence policy emphasising self - reliance and the defence of the australian continent .
known as the defence of australia policy , it focused australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air - sea gap ' ) against possible attack .
in line with this goal , the [MASK] was [MASK] to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from australian bases and to counter raids on continental australia .
this was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the [MASK] and raaf , and relocating regular army units to northern australia .
during this time the [MASK] had no military units on operational deployment outside australia .
however , in 1987 the [MASK] made its first operational deployment as part of operation morris dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off fiji in response to the 1987 [MASK] coups d 'état .
while broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the [MASK] to improve its capability to rapidly respond to [MASK] events .
during this period australia continued to retain forces in malaysia as part of the five power defence [MASK] ( [MASK] ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces .
however , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from singapore in 1973 , and the two [MASK] fighter squadrons in 1988 .
since then a detachment of orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as rifle company [MASK] have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of f / a - 18 [MASK] fighter aircraft .
australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout asian waters in the last decades of the cold war .
[MASK] and navy units were also involved in tracking soviet ship and submarine movements in the region .
since then the [MASK] have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of operation gateway , conducting patrols over the indian ocean , strait of [MASK] and south china sea .
they have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights .
= = = gulf war , 1991 = = =
australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 gulf war , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel .
the australian contribution was the first time australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the [MASK] and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure .
however , the australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against iraq following the invasion of kuwait .
some [MASK] personnel serving on exchange with british and american units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions .
following the war , the navy regularly deployed a frigate to the persian gulf or red sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to iraq .
a number of australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with us and british air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no - fly zones imposed over iraq between 1991 and 2003 .
= = = global security , late - 1990s = = =
since the late 1980s , the australian government had increasingly called upon the [MASK] to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world .
while most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel .
large peacekeeping deployments were made to [MASK] in early 1989 , cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , somalia in 1993 , [MASK] between 1994 and 1995 and [MASK] in 1994 and from 1997 onwards .
the 1996 election of the howard liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the [MASK] 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co - operation with regional states and australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of australia 's global security interests .
in line with this new focus , the [MASK] 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the [MASK] 's combat effectiveness .

the former - portuguese colony of east timor was invaded by indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new indonesian government of president [MASK] [MASK] subsequently agreed to allow the east [MASK] to vote on autonomy in 1999 .
the united nations mission in east timor ( [MASK] ) was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of august 1999 and resulted with 78 .
 5 % of voters deciding in favour of independence .
however , following the announcement of the results pro - indonesian militias supported by elements of the indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and [MASK] and many east [MASK] were killed , while perhaps more than 500 , 000 were displaced .
unable to control the violence , indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force .
australia , which had contributed police to [MASK] , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the international force for east timor ( [MASK] ) , a non - un force operating in accordance with un resolutions .
the total size of the australian force committed numbered 5 , 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of australian forces since 1945 .
under the overall command of australian major general peter [MASK] , [MASK] began arriving on 12 september 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting [MASK] , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations .
with the withdrawal of the indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from east timor , [MASK] re - established its headquarters in dili on 28 september .
on 19 october 1999 , indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a un peacekeeping force , the united nations transitional administration in east timor ( [MASK] ) was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of east timor during its transition to independence .
the hand - over of command of military operations from [MASK] to [MASK] was completed on 28 february 2000 .
australia continued to support the un peacekeeping operation with between 1 , 500 and 2 , 000 personnel , as well as landing craft and [MASK] helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission .
during these operations australian forces regularly clashed with pro - indonesian militia and on a number of occasions indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with west timor .
significant actions occurred in [MASK] , [MASK] [MASK] and at [MASK] in october 1999 .
however , with the security situation [MASK] the bulk of the australian and un forces were withdrawn by 2005 .
two australians died from non - battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action .
the unexpected deployment to east timor in 1999 led to significant changes in australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the [MASK] 's ability to conduct operations outside australia .
this successful deployment was the first time a large australian military force had operated outside of australia since the vietnam war and revealed shortcomings in the [MASK] 's ability to mount and sustain such operations .
in response , the 2000 defence white paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the [MASK] for overseas deployments .
the australian government committed to improve the [MASK] 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of [MASK] units , expanding the [MASK] to 57 , 000 full - time personnel and increasing real defence expenditure by 3 % per year .
in may 2006 , 2 , 000 [MASK] personnel were again deployed to east timor as part of operation [MASK] , following unrest between elements of the timor [MASK] defence force .
australian forces were involved in a number [MASK] during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by [MASK] [MASK] at same on 4 march 2007 .
however , by early - 2010 the security situation had been [MASK] and just 400 australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force .
following a [MASK] , the international [MASK] force commenced withdrawing from timor - [MASK] in november 2012 , a process which was completed in april 2013 .
= = = afghanistan , 2001 – present = = =
shortly after the islamist inspired terrorist attacks in new york and washington on 11 september 2001 , australian forces were committed to the american - led international coalition against terrorism .
the [MASK] 's most visible contribution — codenamed operation [MASK] — has been a special forces task group operating in afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid - 2005 to fight against the [MASK] .
over time the australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a reconstruction task force from 2006 to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the [MASK] national army .
australia has also contributed a frigate and two ap - [MASK] orion surveillance aircraft and three c - 130 [MASK] transport aircraft to international operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean since 2001 , supporting both the operations in afghanistan and those in iraq under operation [MASK] .
a detachment of four f / a - 18 [MASK] fighter - bombers was based at diego garcia from late - 2001 to mid - 2002 , while two boeing [MASK] air - to - air [MASK] aircraft were also based in manas air base in [MASK] to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in [MASK] airspace but were later withdrawn .
a special operations task group was deployed to support the reconstruction [MASK] in april 2007 .
in addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of australian personnel in afghanistan to 950 by mid - 2007 , with further small increases to 1 , 000 in mid - 2008 , 1 , 100 in early 2009 and 1 , 550 in mid - 2009 .
a modest force remained in afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter - insurgency operations in [MASK] province in conjunction united states and other coalition forces , including the dutch prior to their withdrawal .
the force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements .
by 2010 it included a combined arms battalion - sized battle group known as the [MASK] task force , and the special operations task group , both based at forward operation base ripley outside of [MASK] [MASK] , as well as the [MASK] wing group flying ch - [MASK] [MASK] , the force [MASK] [MASK] and an raaf air surveillance radar unit based in [MASK] .
in addition , a further 800 australian logistic personnel were also based in the middle east in support , but are located outside of afghanistan .
meanwhile , [MASK] of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in iraq and afghanistan , based out of al [MASK] air base in the united arab emirates .
also included is the deployment of one of the [MASK] 's frigates to the arabian sea and gulf of aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties .
australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included operation [MASK] in 2002 and operation perth in 2006 , as well as actions in [MASK] in 2007 , [MASK] in 2009 , the shah [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] in 2010 , and [MASK] in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements .
casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another australian also died serving with the british army .
four australians have been awarded the victoria cross for australia , the first such decorations in forty years .
following a [MASK] in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 december 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in [MASK] and [MASK] .
over 26 , 000 australian personnel have served in afghanistan .

australian forces later joined british and american forces during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
the initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just 2 , [MASK] personnel — codenamed operation [MASK] .
major force elements included special forces , [MASK] and fixed wing aviation and naval units .
army units included elements from the [MASK] and 4th battalion , royal australian regiment ( commando ) , a ch - 47 [MASK] detachment and a number of other specialist units .
[MASK] units included the amphibious ship [MASK] [MASK] and the frigates [MASK] darwin and [MASK] anzac , while the raaf deployed 14 f / a - 18 hornets from no.
75 squadron , a number of ap - [MASK] [MASK] and c - 130 [MASK] .
the australian special forces task force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to baghdad were from the [MASK] .
during the invasion the raaf also flew its first combat missions since the vietnam war , with no.
75 squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser - guided bombs .
the iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of australian forces were withdrawn .
while australia did not initially take part in the post - war occupation of iraq , an australian army light armoured [MASK] — designated the al [MASK] task group and including 40 [MASK] light armoured vehicles and infantry — was later deployed to southern iraq in april 2005 as part of operation [MASK] .
the role of this force was to protect the japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of new iraqi army units .
the [MASK] later became the [MASK] battle group ( west ) ( [MASK] ( w ) ) , following the hand back of al [MASK] province to iraqi control .
force levels peaked at 1 , 400 personnel in may 2007 including the [MASK] ( w ) in southern iraq , the security detachment in baghdad and the australian army training team — iraq .
a [MASK] frigate was based in the north persian gulf , while raaf assets included c - [MASK] [MASK] and ap - [MASK] elements .
following the election of a new labor government under prime minister kevin [MASK] the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid - 2009 , while raaf and [MASK] operations were [MASK] to other parts of the middle east area of operations as part of operation [MASK] .
low - level operations continued , however , with a small australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in iraq to protect the australian embassy in baghdad as part of [MASK] under operation [MASK] .
[MASK] was finally withdrawn in august 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for australia 's diplomatic presence in iraq .
although more than 17 , 000 personnel served during operations in iraq , australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third australian died serving with the british royal air force .
a further 27 personnel were wounded .
two officers remained in iraq attached to the united nations assistance mission for iraq as part of operation [MASK] .

australia 's involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both united nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad - hoc coalitions .
australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as [MASK] ; however " in comparative international terms , australia has only been a moderately energetic [MASK] . "
although australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years — being among the first group of un military observers in indonesia in 1947 — its commitments have generally been limited , consisting mostly of small numbers of high - level and technical support troops such as [MASK] , engineers , [MASK] , observers , and police .
one significant commitment has been australia 's ongoing involvement with the long running [MASK] force and observers in the sinai .
the operational tempo started increasing in the mid - 1990s , when australia became involved in a series of high - profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including cambodia , [MASK] , somalia , east timor , and the solomon islands .
australia has been involved in close to 100 separate missions , involving more than 30 , 000 personnel ; 14 australians have died during these operations .

in 1995 churchill discussed her views with david [MASK] in an interview :
you could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in [MASK] - america .
but in anglo - america , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the general [MASK] act , mid - 1880s .
at that point they began to define indian as being someone who was [MASK] and [MASK] of at least one - quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group .
you couldn 't be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth [MASK] and be an indian .
you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter [MASK] or hopefully a quarter and a quarter .
the reason for this was quite clear .
they were identifying indians for purposes of [MASK] them individual [MASK] of land in the existing reservation base at that point .
if they ran out of indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus .
so it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of [MASK] that would minimize the number of indians that were available .
it was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to [MASK] in the first place .
it 's become increasingly so ever since . "

fort scott national historic site is a historical area under the control of the united states national park service in bourbon county , kansas , united states .
named after general winfield scott , who achieved [MASK] during the mexican - american war , during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for us army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850 .
for the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the west to settlement , a period which included bleeding kansas and the american civil war .
the current national historic site protects 20 historic structures , a parade ground , and five acres ( 20 , 000 m ² ) of restored [MASK] prairie , inside the city of fort scott .
it is open to visitors most days of the year .
= = history = =
in 1842 , fort scott was named after winfield scott , was established on the american frontier on the military road in eastern kansas between fort [MASK] and fort gibson .
it was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the eastern united states .
fort scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the plains indians , as well as to protect the indians from the settlers ' encroachment .
the united states government intention to reserve permanent indian lands west of the missouri river gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to [MASK] on the indian settlements .
fort scott 's most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it was also used during the civil war .

the [MASK] of indian territory ( now oklahoma ) were upset to have fort wayne in their proximity .
after some delay , the us army decided to abandon fort wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between fort [MASK] and the site .
the army both wanted to [MASK] the [MASK] ( who were supervised by the department of defense ) and provide more defense for white settlers and other indians against the osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area .
on april 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of fort wayne left their fort and on april 22 arrived where fort scott would be built , in the osage [MASK] section of modern - day kansas .
after [MASK] with the [MASK] to acquire the land , the rest of fort wayne 's garrison left the fort on may 26 and arrived at the fort scott site on may 30 .
unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide - open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary .
the soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment .
these buildings were on the edges of a 350 - foot ( 110 m ) parade ground .
the post [MASK] , captain thomas swords , was in charge of building fort scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the kansas prairie , which had few trees .
he had only two [MASK] and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform .

freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction .
as a result , only one [MASK] of the five planned officers quarters ( four [MASK] and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed .
in his 1844 inspection of the fort , colonel george [MASK] reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered fort scott " above average " .

in her 1844 inspection of the fort , colonel george [MASK] reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered fort scott " above average " .
due to the rising tensions that escalated in the mexican - american war , the us army redeployed troops to the southwest .
with fort scott still uncompleted , officials decided on april 25 , 1850 , that no more construction would be done there , after eight years and $ 35 , 000 .
by the time it was finished , it was obsolete ; three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western fort riley .
for the average soldier , life at the fort was " [MASK] " .
until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort .
aside from a few whiskey [MASK] and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort .
officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including captain swords .
five miles east in missouri was a [MASK] shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts - martial followed soldiers ' going [MASK] at the shop .
the [MASK] rate from the fort ranged from 12 % [MASK] % , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life .
as no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base .
hunting was a popular [MASK] ; according to captain swords , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolerate the place .
= = = bleeding kansas = = =
two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels .
in 1854 the kansas - nebraska act repealed the missouri [MASK] of 1820 , which had kept slavery out of kansas .
[MASK] in favor of slavery soon moved to kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not kansas would permit slavery .
settlers from new england arrived equally determined to keep it out .
each of the two competing factions of the bleeding kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at fort scott : free - soil at the fort scott hotel and pro - [MASK] at the western hotel .
most of the residents in fort scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free - soil side .
during this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted [MASK] , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting .
= = = army returns = = =
during the american civil war , the fort was renewed as a us military post .
in august 1861 , the union army took command of fort scott , and [MASK] it for the war times .
the united states army also took over several blocks within the town for [MASK] and [MASK] functions .
the union army rented the properties from the current civilian owners .
troops from indiana , iowa , colorado , ohio , and wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to [MASK] missouri , arkansas , or the indian territory .
fort scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the united states [MASK] troops of the union army .
a major supply depot was situated at the fort .
confederate general sterling price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away at battle of dry wood creek .
the site was strategically important as it was within a southern - [MASK] area and close to the confederate state of arkansas and the " unstable " indian territory ( present - day state of oklahoma ) , where many of the members of the five [MASK] [MASK] were allied with the confederates .
the fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war .
following the end of the war , in october 1865 the us army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled .
on january 14 , 1870 , the army returned with the formation of the post of southeast kansas .
the post was based at fort scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort .
they were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers .
some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the us government in rights - of - way , would evict them from their [MASK] homes .
the settlers considered the troops [MASK] to the railroads , and [MASK] both as enemies .
settlers also had some continuing conflicts with indians and insurgents using the recent confederate cause as excuse for robbery .
by the spring of 1873 , the us army withdrew the troops from fort scott for good .
from 1873 to 1965 , the buildings of the fort were left [MASK] , and slowly deteriorated .
many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use .

with the act of august 31 , 1965 , the national park service gave the city government of fort scott , kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort .
on october 19 , 1978 , fort scott became a national historic site under the supervision of the national park service , encompassing 17 acres ( 69 , 000 m2 ) .
today the fort is open throughout the year , save for [MASK] , christmas , and new years day .

home made [MASK] pie is a 1910 american silent short comedy produced by the thanhouser company .
the film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the gale family is going to host a dinner .
the focus of the humor is in a [MASK] [MASK] that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more [MASK] , but three people each add brandy to the [MASK] .
everyone becomes [MASK] upon eating the [MASK] , including the family cat , and the film concludes .
no cast or staff credits for this film are known .
the film was released on september 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews in trade publications .
reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one [MASK] split eight ways would be able to impact everyone .

though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in the moving picture world from september 24 , 1910 .
it states : " life in a country town is often tedious and [MASK] , and were it not for the little [MASK] and [MASK] the [MASK] are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed .
so the time honored get - [MASK] of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay .
the [MASK] thought well of this established feature .
they made it a [MASK] occasion for themselves as well as their guests .
they were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an [MASK] of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . "
" on the night before such an event neither [MASK] , [MASK] , or [MASK] gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort .
at the first [MASK] of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the [MASK] into shape .
so little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] - the [MASK] were ever looking after the need of the said [MASK] .
first [MASK] gale would [MASK] to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then [MASK] gale would [MASK] over and give it a stir ; finally [MASK] gale would have to come over and honor it likewise .
then arrived the guests .

the single reel comedy , approximately 1 , 000 feet long , was released on september 27 , 1910 .
the film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in indiana , kansas , wisconsin , and pennsylvania .

in 1917 , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the pennsylvania state board of [MASK] of moving pictures .
the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault .
the reviewer states , " a domestic comedy with a different flavor .

what happened to the guests who [MASK] of it certainly draws upon the imagination .

the [MASK] [MASK] episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to [MASK] out to anyone . "
walton of the moving picture news was not [MASK] by the plot and stated , " to me the last scene had no humor .
it was only the necessary ending to the beginning .
true humor does not [MASK] from [MASK] . "
the new york dramatic mirror stated , " this is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way .
the early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation .
... a weak point in the story is the fact that the [MASK] is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power .
two [MASK] would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing .
the character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . "

commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by starr on her former beatles [MASK] paul mccartney .
starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by [MASK] and nothing more " , beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes .
starr had publicly criticised mccartney 's solo albums mccartney ( 1970 ) and ram ( 1971 ) on release , and author bruce [MASK] [MASK] the message of the middle eight as " a plea for paul to produce better music " .
the mention of " sound [ ing ] wasted " could also be a reference to mccartney 's [MASK] with cannabis , rodriguez suggests .
a further example of starr 's allegedly anti - mccartney message exists in the song 's first verse :
wake up , [MASK]
don 't pretend that you are dead
get yourself up off the cart .
the same commentators suggest that here starr could be referring to the 1969 " paul is dead " hoax .

= where the streets have no name =
" where the streets have no name " is a song by irish rock band u2 .
it is the opening track from their 1987 album the joshua tree and was released as the album 's third single in august 1987 .
the song 's hook is a repeating guitar [MASK] using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end .
lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in belfast .
during the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer brian eno considered [MASK] the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch .
" where the streets have no name " was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the us , number fourteen in canada , number ten in the netherlands , and number four in the united kingdom .
the song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on the joshua tree tour .
the song was performed on a los angeles [MASK] for the filming of its music video , which won a grammy award for best performance music video .
= = writing and recording = =
the music for " where the streets have no name " originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions .
in an upstairs room at [MASK] house — his newly purchased home — the edge used a four - track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine .

with no one in the house to share the demo with , the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration .
although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song .
[MASK] adam clayton said , " at the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " .
the arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was [MASK] many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked .
according to co - producer daniel lanois , " that was the science project song .
i remember having this massive schoolhouse [MASK] , as we call them .
i was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking [MASK] .
it was ridiculous . "
co - producer brian eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of " where the streets have no name " .
the band worked on a single take for weeks , but as eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up .
through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance .
so much time had been spent on " [MASK] work " that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch .
his idea was to " stage an accident " and have the song 's tapes erased .

at one point , eno had the tapes [MASK] up and ready to be recorded over , but this [MASK] never took place ; according to engineer flood , fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the [MASK] of tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno .

the studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes .
it was one of several songs mixed by steve [MASK] in the final months of recording the joshua tree .
drummer larry mullen , jr. later said of the song , " it took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it .
it only became a truly great song through playing live .
on the record , musically , it 's not half the song it is live . "
= = composition = =
" where the streets have no name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute .
the introduction and [MASK] are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature .
the songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with [MASK] - like sustained [MASK] notes .
the guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " [MASK] " six - note [MASK] .
a " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note in the [MASK] twice , thus creating a rich sound .
the bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 .
the introduction , following a i – iv – i – iv – vi – v – i chord progression , creates a " wall of sound " , as described by mark butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes .
the guitar part played for the remainder of the song features the edge strumming [MASK] sixteenth notes .
the bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while bono 's vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its [MASK] , ( " he [MASK] ; he [MASK] ; he [MASK] ; he [MASK] [MASK] ; he allows his voice to crack " ) as well as timing by his usage of [MASK] to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat .

this development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line " burning down love " ( a – g – f ♯ – d ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the [MASK] at " burning " .
in later choruses , bono sings " blown by the wind " with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer .
after the third chorus , the song 's [MASK] is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six - note guitar [MASK] played against sustained [MASK] notes .

the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets of belfast , northern ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on .
he contrasted this with the [MASK] he felt when visiting ethiopia , saying : " ... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions , a place where the streets have no name .

to me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together ... maybe that 's the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . "
bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife , ali hewson ; he first wrote them down on an [MASK] bag while staying in a village .

the open - ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations .

the video begins with an aerial shot of a block in los angeles , and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc [MASK] stating that u2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30 , 000 people .
police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance .
two minutes into the video , u2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th [MASK] and s. main st. , and perform " where the streets have no name " to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building .
towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are [MASK] the police .
the video for " where the streets have no name " was directed by [MASK] avis and produced by michael [MASK] and ben [MASK] .
the band attracted over 1 , 000 people during the video 's filming , which took place on the [MASK] of a liquor store in downtown los angeles on 27 march 1987 .
the band 's performance on a [MASK] in a public place was a reference to the beatles ' final concert , as depicted in the film let it be .
during the shoot u2 played an eight - song set , which included four performances of " where the streets have no name " .
prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be [MASK] by a group of fans .
a backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filming .
the depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video .
[MASK] was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police .
according to avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day " almost in real time " , and that " getting [MASK] was an integral part of the plan . "
band manager paul mcguinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to [MASK] the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video .
in the background of the video is a sign for the million dollar hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot .
although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio - recorded version of the song .
the video won the grammy award for best performance music video at the 1989 grammy awards .

" race against time " was released on the 12 - inch , cassette , and cd versions of the single .
the song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk , and was described by the edge as " a kind of afro - rhythmic piece " and " a study in rhythm . "
the bass riff in the song , inspired by the [MASK] , was played by the edge , but stemmed from some of clayton 's unused bass parts .
mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take .
the song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by bono 's trip to ethiopia after live aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include bono singing in an ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " race against time " .

the track was used in the miami vice episode " child 's play " , and is the only one of the single 's b - sides that was never played live .
" silver and gold " was written in support of the artists united against [MASK] project , which protested the south african apartheid .
in 1985 , bono participated in steven van [MASK] 's anti - apartheid sun city project and spent time with keith richards and mick jagger of the rolling stones .

the edge described it as " a beautiful song ... which is pop as it should be — not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity " , also noting that " it 's very new for us . "
it was re - recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for the best of 1980 – 1990 .

upon the release of the joshua tree , critics praised " where the streets have no name " .
steve [MASK] of the boston globe noted the " bell - like tones from the edge [MASK] [ e ] a search for heaven " and along with the subsequent track on the album , " i still haven 't found what i 'm looking for " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " .
the bergen record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest .
rolling stone called it " assertive rock " in their review of the joshua tree .
the san diego union - tribune said of " where the streets have no name " , " the music charges , like someone fleeing for life " .
the washington post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in bono 's resolute delivery , dave ( the edge ) evan 's [MASK] guitar , adam clayton 's cathedral bass and larry mullen 's rolling thunder drums " .
nme lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album " starts by spitting furiously " .
the publication praised bono 's impassioned singing and the edge 's guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into " something more than an [MASK] abused piece of wood " .

" where the streets have no name " made its concert debut on 2 april 1987 in [MASK] , arizona on the opening night of the joshua tree tour .
it has since been played at nearly every full - length concert that u2 has [MASK] , totaling over 700 performances as of 2011 .
the song is widely regarded as one of the group 's most popular live songs .
bono said of it , " we can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes .
the audience is on its feet , singing along with every word .
it 's like god suddenly walks through the room . "
on the joshua tree tour , " where the streets have no name " was most often used to open concerts .
fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting .
the san diego union - tribune wrote that , " from the [MASK] sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , this audience was up , [MASK] and [MASK] . "
nme wrote that the song is one such occasion where " the power afforded their songs is scary " , noting that during the song 's opening , " the arena [MASK] " .
in other reviews , the song was called : " [MASK] " , " [MASK] " , and " powerful " .
out of the 109 shows during the joshua tree tour , " streets " was played at all except 12 of the concerts .
during the [MASK] tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 , " streets " was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts .
the song was performed at every show on the 1992 – 1993 zoo tv tour .
concerts from this tour were elaborate [MASK] [MASK] that bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including " where the streets have no name " , straight .
some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from the joshua tree 's photo shoot .
the video was [MASK] up for humorous effect — nme described the effect as giving it a " silly , charlie [MASK] quality " — and bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens .

this video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the u2 360 ° tour .
some of the zoo tv performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the pet shop boys ' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " where the streets have no name ( i can 't take my eyes off you ) " ) .
bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the pet shop boys ' cover .
critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist : the independent said the song " [MASK] instant euphoria , as u2 do what they 're best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena " .
in two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits .
for the popmart tour of 1997 – 1998 , u2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the zoo tv tour .
the set 's massive video screen displayed a video that hot press described as an " astonishing , 2001 - style trip into the heart of a [MASK] , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal [MASK] " .
near the end of the song , peace [MASK] were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards .
hot press said the effect transformed the stadium into a " ufo landing site " .
shortly before the third leg of the [MASK] tour , the september 11 attacks occurred in new york city and washington d.c. during the band 's first show in new york city following the attacks , the band performed " where the streets have no name " , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans .
the experience was one inspiration for the song " city of [MASK] lights " .
the band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the super bowl [MASK] halftime show on 3 february 2002 .
the performance featured the names of the september 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band .
u2 's appearance was later ranked number 1 on sports illustrated 's list of " top 10 super bowl [MASK] [MASK] " .
for the vertigo tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their [MASK] , but mullen and clayton successfully argued against this .
all 131 of the vertigo tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage 's led video [MASK] displaying african flags .

= [MASK] [MASK] reaction =
the [MASK] [MASK] reaction ( often referred to as simply the [MASK] [MASK] ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of [MASK] .
the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed .
it was originally discovered by ivan [MASK] [MASK] ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while studying the [MASK] of [MASK] vinyl [MASK] .
as originally described , the [MASK] [MASK] involves the activation of a [MASK] [MASK] using a stoichiometric lewis acid or [MASK] acid promoter .
the key step of the reaction mechanism involves a [MASK] [MASK] - [MASK] ring closure which forms the [MASK] product ( see [MASK] below ) .
as the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name [MASK] [MASK] provided that they follow a similar [MASK] pathway .
the success of the [MASK] [MASK] as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and [MASK] of [MASK] as both motifs in natural products ( including [MASK] , the [MASK] , and a [MASK] of [MASK] ) and as useful synthetic [MASK] for total synthesis .
the reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published .
= = [MASK] = =
the mechanism of the classical [MASK] [MASK] reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by [MASK] to be an [MASK] [MASK] and is outlined below .
[MASK] of the [MASK] by the acid catalyst generates a [MASK] cation which undergoes a [MASK] allowed [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] as dictated by the woodward - hoffman rules .
this generates an [MASK] cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β - hydrogen .
subsequent [MASK] of the [MASK] produces the [MASK] product .
as noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what [MASK] a [MASK] [MASK] in particular is the generation of the [MASK] cation followed by [MASK] ring closure to an [MASK] cation .
in order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s - trans / s - trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation .
the [MASK] of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α - substituted substrates having an increased population of the [MASK] [MASK] due to [MASK] strain .
[MASK] of an electron [MASK] α - [MASK] by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation .
similarly , β - substitution directed inward [MASK] the s - trans conformation so severely that e - z [MASK] has been shown to occur in advance of [MASK] on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans [MASK] regardless of initial configuration .
in this way , the [MASK] [MASK] is a rare example of a [MASK] [MASK] reaction , whereas most [MASK] are [MASK] .
the example below uses [MASK] hydride to trap the [MASK] cation so that no elimination occurs .
( see [MASK] [MASK] below )
along this same vein , [MASK] vinyl [MASK] of the type studied extensively by marcus [MASK] of the university of hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β - [MASK] , [MASK] a large amount of [MASK] strain in the s - [MASK] [MASK] .
= = classical [MASK] [MASK] = =
though [MASK] following the general template above had been observed prior to [MASK] 's involvement , it was his study of the [MASK] of [MASK] vinyl [MASK] that marked the first major examination of this process .

[MASK] correctly reasoned that the [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] in situ to form a [MASK] [MASK] before ring closure to the [MASK] product .
the reaction shown below involves an [MASK] [MASK] reaction to generate the [MASK] [MASK] .
research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid - 1980s when several syntheses employing the [MASK] [MASK] were published .
[MASK] below are key steps in the syntheses of [MASK] and nor - [MASK] , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual [MASK] - [MASK] [MASK] that generates the [MASK] [MASK] .
= = = [MASK] = = =
the classical version of the [MASK] [MASK] suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to [MASK] .
the first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to [MASK] ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and [MASK] of the intermediate .
strong lewis or [MASK] acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g.
[MASK] , [MASK] , [MASK] ) .
these [MASK] are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope .
despite the [MASK] possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction .
this limits the atom economy of the reaction .
the elimination step is not [MASK] ; if multiple β - [MASK] are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures .
this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as [MASK] separation is typically required .
[MASK] destroys a potential [MASK] , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction .
[MASK] of the [MASK] is sometimes not [MASK] , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of [MASK] .
= = modern variants = =
the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the [MASK] [MASK] reaction in its canonical form .
however , modifications to the reaction focused on [MASK] its issues continue to be an active area of academic research .
in particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , [MASK] the reaction with more mild [MASK] to improve functional group tolerance , directing the [MASK] of the elimination step , and improving the overall [MASK] .
these have been successful to varying degrees .
additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the [MASK] cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the [MASK] cation " intercepted " in various ways .
furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed .
the sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below .
= = = [MASK] - directed [MASK] = = =
the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the [MASK] [MASK] took advantage of the β - silicon effect in order to direct the [MASK] of the elimination step .
this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark of the university of illinois , [MASK] - [MASK] in the mid - 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron [MASK] to promote the reaction .
with [MASK] products , the [MASK] [MASK] was selected for to varying degrees .
the silicon - directed [MASK] [MASK] reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product [MASK] , shown below .
the [MASK] takes place before elimination of the [MASK] alcohol [MASK] , so that the resulting [MASK] of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the [MASK] [MASK] anti to the [MASK] .
= = = [MASK] = = =
drawing on the [MASK] effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , professor alison frontier of the university of rochester developed a paradigm for " polarized " [MASK] [MASK] in which electron [MASK] and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction .
creation of an effective vinyl [MASK] and vinyl [MASK] in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper [MASK] and [MASK] elimination .
in addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the [MASK] of the α - proton , allowing selective formation of the trans - α - [MASK] via [MASK] .
it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a [MASK] or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . )
is typically lower .
= = = alternative cation generation = = =
by extension , any [MASK] cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a [MASK] [MASK] .
there have been a large number of examples published where the [MASK] cation is arrived at by a variety of [MASK] .
one such example involves the silver [MASK] [MASK] ring opening of [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .
the silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of [MASK] silver chloride .
in the total synthesis of [MASK] , [MASK] of a vinyl [MASK] [MASK] likewise generates a [MASK] cation via ring opening of the resultant [MASK] .
= = = [MASK] [MASK] = = =
once the [MASK] has occurred , an [MASK] cation is formed .
as discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by [MASK] [MASK] .
however , these two steps can be interrupted by various [MASK] and [MASK] , respectively .
[MASK] cation trapping has been developed extensively by [MASK] g. west of the university of alberta and his review covers the field .
[MASK] cation trapping has been developed extensively by [MASK] g. west of the university of alberta and her review covers the field .
the [MASK] cation can be trapped with [MASK] and carbon [MASK] and can also undergo [MASK] [MASK] with various [MASK] partners .
[MASK] below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a [MASK] core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity .
[MASK] trapping with various [MASK] is [MASK] less common .
in one study , the [MASK] [MASK] is paired with a michael reaction using an [MASK] catalyst to initiate nucleophilic [MASK] addition of the [MASK] to β - [MASK] .
in this tandem reaction the [MASK] catalyst is required for both [MASK] : it acts as the lewis acid in the [MASK] [MASK] and in the next step the [MASK] group of [MASK] first coordinates to [MASK] in a ligand exchange with the [MASK] [MASK] oxygen atom before the actual michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the r - group .
= = = [MASK] variants = = =
the development of an enantioselective [MASK] [MASK] is a desirable addition to the repertoire of [MASK] [MASK] reactions .
to that end , several variations have been developed utilizing [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] .
[MASK] [MASK] are also known , in which extant [MASK] direct the [MASK] .
almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of [MASK] ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to " [MASK] " in turn sets the [MASK] as shown below .
[MASK] - directed [MASK] [MASK] can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way .
in the example below , the [MASK] - group acts to direct the [MASK] by preventing the distant [MASK] from rotating " towards " it via unfavorable [MASK] interaction .
in this way the silicon acts as a [MASK] auxiliary .
( the starting material is not [MASK] but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the [MASK] . )
[MASK] 's [MASK] substrates can exhibit axial to [MASK] [MASK] transfer if [MASK] [MASK] are used .
the example below generates a [MASK] [MASK] in 64 % yield and 95 % enantiomeric excess .
[MASK] has additionally developed a camphor - based auxiliary for [MASK] [MASK] that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of [MASK] .
the key step employs an unusual mixture of [MASK] - 2 - [MASK] and [MASK] as solvent .
the first [MASK] lewis acid promoted asymmetric [MASK] [MASK] was reported by [MASK] aggarwal and utilized copper ( ii ) [MASK] ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee .
the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 [MASK] % of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased .
= = related reactions = =
[MASK] of the [MASK] [MASK] are generally also subsumed under the same name .
for example , an α - β , γ - [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] can undergo a similar [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] that is typically referred to as an [MASK] - [MASK] [MASK] reaction .
other such extensions have been given similar names , including [MASK] - [MASK] [MASK] and [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

because they [MASK] the [MASK] cation , β - electron [MASK] [MASK] often severely impede [MASK] [MASK] .
building from this , several [MASK] ring openings of β - [MASK] [MASK] have been reported .
these are typically referred to as retro - [MASK] [MASK] reactions .

even these tend to suffer from poor [MASK] , poor yields , or narrow scope .
the difficulty stems from the relative over - stabilization of the [MASK] cation by electron donation , [MASK] [MASK] .

[MASK] [MASK] is a 2011 american black comedy film directed by seth gordon , written by michael [MASK] , john francis [MASK] and jonathan goldstein , based on a story by [MASK] .
it stars jason bateman , charlie day , jason sudeikis , jennifer aniston , colin farrell , kevin spacey , and jamie [MASK] .
the plot follows three friends , played by bateman , day , and sudeikis , who decide to murder their respective overbearing , abusive bosses , portrayed by spacey , aniston and farrell .
[MASK] 's script was bought by new line cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre - production , with a variety of actors attached to different roles .
by 2010 , goldstein and [MASK] had rewritten the script , and the film finally went into production .
the film premiered in los angeles on june 30 , 2011 , and received a wide release on july 8 , 2011 .
the film exceeded financial expectations , [MASK] over $ 28 million in the first three days , making it the number two film in the united states during its opening weekend , and going on to become the highest - grossing black comedy film of all time in [MASK] dollars , breaking the record previously set by the war of the roses in 1990 .
the film grossed over $ [MASK] million worldwide during its theatrical run .
the film opened to positive critical reception , with several critics praising the ensemble cast , with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews .
the plot received a more mixed response ; some reviewers felt that its dark , humorous premise was explored well , while others felt the jokes were racist , [MASK] , and [MASK] .
a sequel , [MASK] [MASK] 2 , was released on november 26 , 2014 .

it earned $ 432 million worldwide , becoming the sixth highest grossing film of 2002 .
die another day became a controversial subject in eastern asia .
the north korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war - hungry .
the south koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 december 2002 , as they were offended by the scene in which an american officer issues orders to the south korean army in the defence of their homeland , and by a [MASK] scene near a statue of the buddha .
the [MASK] buddhist order issued a statement that the film was " [MASK] to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics " .
the washington post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the united states .
an official of the south korean ministry of culture and tourism said that die another day was " the wrong film at the wrong time . "
the amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism , specifically from various news outlets such as the bbc , time and reuters who all used the pun " buy another day " .
reportedly 20 companies , paying $ 70 million , had their products featured in the film , a record at the time , although usa today reported that number to be as high as $ 100 million .
by choice , the number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for the next bond film casino [MASK] in 2006 .
rotten tomatoes listed die another day with a 58 % rating .

james [MASK] of [MASK] said , " this is a train wreck of an action film – a [MASK] attempt by the filmmakers to force - feed james bond into the mindless [MASK] mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud [MASK] . "

gary brown of the houston community newspapers also described the weak point of the film as " the seemingly non - stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the bond character is almost relegated to second string . "
roger moore remarked , " i thought it just went too far – and that ’ s from me , the first bond in space !
